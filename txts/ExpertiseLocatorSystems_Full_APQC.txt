Executive Summary

As organizations become more complex and more globally dispersed and as expertise becomes more 

specialized, leaders are looking for methods to help employees determine where to search and ﬁ nd 
answers. Th  ey want to minimize the amount of time employees spend looking for existing knowledge 
and information and to design and deploy approaches to ﬁ nd expertise that are eﬀ ective and that people 
will use.

 Organizations are turning to expertise locator systems. An expertise locator system (ELS) is an 

integrated approach involving people, process, technology, and content that is designed to:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  provide support for teams and communities of practice.

connect people to people,
link people to information about people,
identify people with expertise and link them to those with questions or problems,
identify potential staﬀ  members for projects requiring speciﬁ c expertise,
assist in career development, and

APQC has worked with and studied hundreds of organizations and their KM initiatives, from early 
adopters to recent entrants. To help organizations design, implement, or enhance their ELS based on 
innovative practices and real-world experience, APQC and the study sponsors collected information 
from and conducted site visits with ﬁ ve organizations with outstanding ELS approaches. Two additional 
partners presented their approaches at the study knowledge transfer session.

Th  e study addressed the following key issues related to expertise locator systems:

•  Objectives and approaches—determining user needs, establishing a business case, deﬁ ning expertise, 

identifying experts, and targeting user groups

•  Design components—making build versus buy decisions for technology acquisition, integrating 
applications, creating and maintaining proﬁ les, adopting a taxonomy, and controlling vocabulary
•  Pilot and launch—establishing project methodologies, managing change, ensuring participation, 

communicating and training, and rewarding and recognizing
•  Measures and results—measuring the use and success of ELS
•  Costs—funding, staﬃ  ng, and maintaining 

A brief summary of the ﬁ ndings follows, with details in the sections of the report and in the partner 

proﬁ le section of the best-practice site visit partners.

BEST-PRACTICE PARTNERS

To ﬁ nd best practices in ELS, APQC identiﬁ ed more than 40 potential partners, screened seven who 
met the criteria of having an integrated ELS, conducted phone interviews with this group, and selected 
ﬁ ve best-practice organizations for site visits. Th  e ﬁ ve organizations were Air Products, Honeywell, 
Intel, Northrop Grumman, and Schlumberger. Th  e following is a brief description of the partners’ ELS 
approaches.

Air Products

Air Products built its ELS on a well-established manual process of identifying the R&D staﬀ  members 
who asked to be alerted to developments in their areas of interest. Two technology scouts monitored the 
not-yet-published literature from universities and laboratories and alerted the staﬀ  according to interests 
indicated in their proﬁ les. Providing technology alerts was inducement enough for R&D and technical 
staﬀ  to keep their proﬁ les current.

Air Products’ KM group assumed oversight of the ELS and supported the automation of the existing 
manual system. Using internal resources, Air Products designed its own MS Windows-compatible 
application, which has alloedw it to continue to reﬁ ne the system at minimal cost.

Honeywell

When an internal review found few formal initiatives existing to help knowledge ﬂ ow across 
boundaries, Honeywell analyzed user needs, the company culture, and potential pilots. Based on the 
analysis, it decided to create knowledge networks.

To enable these networks, Honeywell adopted an expertise locator system. Rather than designate 
“experts”—a concept that would not be accepted by other employees—the company designed its system 
based on knowledge seekers and knowledge providers. Pilots in Six Sigma and customer support areas 
provided measurable proof of concept and led to a roll out in other parts of the company.

Intel

Th  e mission of KM at Intel is to increase the rate of learning and innovation by connecting 
knowledge workers and enabling the capture and reuse of their actionable knowledge. Strategic initiatives 
in the KM function are divided into people, process, and technology categories. After conducting an 
internal assessment of business needs from the users’ perspectives, Intel’s information technology (IT) 
organization identiﬁ ed the need for an ELS system to serve the people category and prioritized it as the 
most-needed capability.

Th  e ELS system serves to link employees to the ELS database via e-mail, intranet, shared servers, and 
instant messenger. Once connected to the system, the user can perform a natural language search for 
existing people or solutions. If the search does not provide the sought-after information, then the user 
can query the system (an expert or a group of experts). Once an expert answers the question, the system 
automatically captures and stores the solution. In some instances, the system may share the solution 
with a subscriber-base interested in the particular area of discussion. 

Northrop Grumman

Northrop Grumman’s initial impetus to create an ELS was the need to ﬁ nd staﬀ  experienced in the 
B-2 bomber program in order to maintain ongoing support for the program. Th  is initiative expanded to

the XRef system, in which employees can complete proﬁ les that identify skills and experience. Employees 
are eager to keep the proﬁ les up to date because candidates for future programs and projects are identiﬁ ed 
through the proﬁ les in the XRef system. XRef has also beneﬁ ted the “discipline management” process—
the process of anticipating and managing work force skill requirements.

Schlumberger

Schlumberger has been focusing on connecting people to people and people to content since 1993, 
when an Austin-based team began a grassroots eﬀ ort to create a directory. Knowledge management grew 
from the bottom using a Darwinian approach: certain ideas survived and others did not. Some of the 
more successful ideas began as little skunkworks projects: small developments in localized areas. Th  e 
projects received the recognition of management and gained credibility. Now, Schlumberger does not 
have one ELS; it has four: the corporate directory, the Knowledge Hub (the portal), Eureka communities 
of practice, and InTouch expertise support for ﬁ eld engineers. 

Detailed proﬁ les on the ﬁ ve site-visit partners’ ELS approaches are included in this report.

OVERVIEW OF MAJOR FINDINGS
1.  Partners designate expertise, not necessarily experts. Often a first concern raised by someone 
considering an ELS is the potential burden on anyone designated as an expert. After all, experts 
are in short supply and do not have extra time to answer questions from colleagues in the ﬁ eld. 
Further, providing answers may not be part of their job responsibilities. Th  e study shows that most 
partners help employees ﬁ nd expertise and knowledge providers while not designating individuals 
as “experts.” Honeywell employees who are reluctant to identify themselves as experts were willing 
to participate in the system as knowledge providers. When experts are designated in mission-critical 
situations, as they are by Schlumberger and Air Products, the expert’s job description includes this 
role. Th  e implications of this shift from expert to knowledge provider are explored in Chapter 1.

2.  Partners design the ELS to meet unique objectives. Th  e study team identiﬁ ed three diﬀ erent models 
for positioning ELS in the organization. Model one, the knowledge provider and seeker model, 
focuses on connecting people to people. All partners use this model in some form. Model two, 
used by Northrop Grumman and Rockwell Collins, positions the ELS as a way to staﬀ  projects and 
support competency management in the ﬁ rm. Model three positions ELS in the traditional mode of 
identifying designated experts. In addition to Models one and two, Schlumberger and Air Products 
use model three. Each partner’s ELS is part of a larger knowledge-sharing strategy.

3.  Partners allow people to self-report skills, expertise, and interests. Providing employees with control 
over the data that they report keeps many privacy concerns at bay and helps companies abide by 
U.S. law and international law. Th  e privacy issue is explored more fully in the report and the partner 
proﬁ les.

4.  Partners understand work process, needs, and culture before designing an ELS. Th  e partners who have 
the greatest global reach and enterprise ELS coverage collect information regarding the needs and 
culture of the target groups before implementation. Data collection includes interviews, surveys, and 
work ﬂ ow analysis. As a result, the ELS enjoys a high degree of acceptance and use.

Key Points

Highlight of the Findings
•  Partners designate expertise, not necessarily experts
•  Partners design the ELS to meet unique objectives
•  Partners allow people to self-report skills, expertise, and interests.
•  Partners understand work process, needs, and culture before designing an 

ELS. 

•  Partners use a staged approach (which includes a pilot) for design, 

implementation, and launch.

•  Technology is a key enabler for ELS
•  Marketing, communication, and training are essential for increasing system 

use.

•  Cross-functional representation is a characteristic of successful ELS design 

teams.

•  Partners link and leverage the ELS by attaching it to another accepted process 

or group of practitioners.

•  Most business cases are based on compelling need to enable processes, not 

ﬁ nancial return.

•  Ongoing maintenance costs for the ELS are modest by IT standards.

5  Partners use a staged approach (which includes a pilot) for design, implementation, and launch. Several 
partners began with small or deﬁ ned pilots and found them to be key enablers in reﬁ ning the ELS 
and building a business case for expansion. Keys to pilot success include using criteria to select the 
right pilots, designing the launch to accommodate the existing culture, and having robust measures 
in place to evaluate the pilot.

6.  Technology is a key enabler for ELS. Many of the partners purchased their ELS applications, and two 
built their own. Th  e right technology is critical for scalability and to expand networks of contacts 
beyond immediate communities or functions. Th  e technology should be compatible with existing 
platforms and databases. Th  e “build versus buy” decision is explored fully in the technology section, 
as is how ELS applications integrate with other applications such as HR databases.

7.  Marketing, communication, and training are essential for increasing system use. All of the partners 

devote signiﬁ cant design time and resources to this aspect of launching and maintaining an ELS. 

8.   Cross-functional representation is a characteristic of successful ELS design teams. Cross-functional 
teams ensure better designs and higher acceptance. Th  e teams are instrumental in developing the 
taxonomy used in the ELS.

9.   Partners link and leverage the ELS by attaching it to another accepted process or group of practitioners. 
Partners increase the legitimacy and reach of the ELS by having a group (such as the knowledge 
management team or a steering committee) provide oversight and coordination.

10. Most business cases are based on compelling need to enable processes, not financial return. Partners’ 
initial business cases were typically based on demonstrated need and a KM or KM-like strategy. All 
partners have measures (both usage and success), which they track and report. Th  e measures provide 
continuing proof to the organization that the ELS is meeting its objectives.

11. Ongoing maintenance costs for the ELS are modest by IT standards. Partners report that an ELS requires 
a relatively small number of IT and KM staﬀ  for maintenance. Low maintenance costs make the 
system less susceptible to budget cuts.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT

Th  is report is organized around the key steps in the process of designing, deploying, maintaining, 
and measuring an ELS. It begins with a description of these various steps and best practices and then 
proceeds through the detailed descriptions of partners’ approaches and design choices. Th  e ﬁ rst section 
of this report provides an overview of the study ﬁ ndings and best practices in all aspects of ELS. It begins 
with a discussion of the various perspectives regarding what constitutes “expertise,” which was a deﬁ ning 
characteristic of the partner approaches. It also includes the original business cases and needs that drove 
the decision to implement ELS. Th  e second section covers the ELS design details, implementation and 
launch strategies, cultural design factors, technology choices and implications, measures, and results.  
Th  e ﬁ nal section includes the detailed case studies of the partners’ expertise location systems, how they 
selected their technology, change management approaches, lessons learned, and the measures they used 
to evaluate their ELS.

BENCHMARKING METHODOLOGY

APQC’s benchmarking methodology was developed in 1993 and serves as one of the premier 
methods for successful benchmarking in the world. It is an extremely powerful tool for identifying best 
and innovative practices and for facilitating the actual transfer of those practices.

Phase I: Plan—Th  e planning phase of the study began in May 2003. During that period, secondary 
research sources were used to identify potential best-practice organizations. Each identiﬁ ed organization 
was invited to participate in a screening process. Based on the results of the screening process, as well as 
company capacity or willingness to participate in the study, the ﬁ nal list of seven partners was developed. 
A virtual meeting with the sponsors and a kickoﬀ  meeting were held in July 2003, during which APQC 
and the sponsors developed the site visit guide.

Phase 2: Collect—Two tools were used to collect information for this study.

1.  Screening survey—qualitative and quantitative questions designed to determine if organization has 

best practices that ﬁ t within the study scope

2.  Site visit guide — qualitative questions, which serve as the structured discussion framework for all 

site visits

3.  Five partners participated in virtual site visits. Th  e APQC study team prepared written reports 
(partner proﬁ les) of each site visit and submitted it to the partner organization for approval or 
clariﬁ cation.

WHY EXPERTISE LOCATOR SYSTEMS?

Why are organizations so interested in an expertise locator system (ELS)? Th  e immediate goals of an 
ELS are often tactical: connecting people to people and identifying skills and expertise. But in all cases, 
the ELS serves a larger strategic initiative and purpose, such as to enable faster learning, innovation, 
better practice and to share better processes. For this reason, this study did not ﬁ nd any ELS installations 
as stand-alone activities; all were embedded in a larger knowledge-sharing initiative.

For example, the mission of KM at Intel is to increase the rate of learning and innovation by 
connecting knowledge workers and enabling the capture and reuse of their actionable knowledge. Intel 
provides a host of capabilities that the KM and IT teams used to achieve this mission, of which the ELS 
is just one. 

At Northrop Grumman, the ELS is owned by a central KM team that is chartered to enable:
the reuse of “what we know,” regardless of location; 
learning, deciding, and adapting faster than the competition; and 
collaboration across boundaries.

• 
• 
• 

Northrop Grumman’s ELS activities are designed for peer-to-peer interaction via a cross-reference 
tool named the Xref system. Locating peers was the original purpose of the Xref system. Th  e tool was 
created in 1995 speciﬁ cally for the B-2 engineering project that was coming to a close, in order to 
maintain proﬁ les of staﬀ  who could be used for future B-2 support.

At both Northrop Grumman and Air Products, the KM team was assigned oversight for an already-

existing ELS, thereby bringing it into the fold of a larger strategic initiative.

Partners gave a variety of reasons for establishing their ELS. Th  ese reasons were important in shaping 
the ELS design and the model they adopted. Th  e following are verbatim reasons given by partners for 
establishing their ELS. Th  e ﬁ gure below depicts the reasons given by partners in their screening survey. 

Key Points

Why Expertise Locator Systems?

•  Connect people with knowledge to people who need it, quickly and more 

precisely.

•  Uncover previously unknown skills or experience that may apply to today’s or 

tomorrow’s projects and problems.

•  Supplement a broader corporate knowledge-sharing strategy.

Air Products

“We needed to send technology alerts to carefully targeted individuals within the company. To 
ensure that the right information reached the right people in a timely fashion, we collected proﬁ les of 
individuals throughout our R&D community, including their interests and professional experience. 
Once these proﬁ les were made available on the intranet, other community members began using it to 
locate individuals with key skills, especially in other geographic locations; and many functional groups 
outside of R&D adopted the system.”

WHAT IS MEANT BY “EXPERT” VARIES

Th  e study sponsors were very interested in how companies deal with the possible burden an ELS 
might impose on subject matter experts. One of the most important ﬁ ndings of this study has been the 
way “expert” is operationally deﬁ ned in the partners’ ELS approaches. Partners found that employees were 
reluctant to be labeled as an expert unless they had been formally designated as such by management. 

Key Points

What is Meant by “Expert” Varies

•  Sponsors’ greatest interest concerned the issues around designating someone 

as an expert and tasking employees with answering questions.

•  Most partners bypass the issue by focusing on helping people ﬁ nd expertise 

and “knowledge providers,” not designating individuals as “experts.”

•  Partners clearly deﬁ ne the role of expert and communicate the expectations 
for the role, which is critically important in companies such as Air Products 
and Schlumberger that rely on experts for mission-critical decisions. 

•  Three different models of expertise location were used by the partners.

18

Expertise Locator Systems: Finding the Answers  •  ©2003 APQC

C H A P T E R   1

Th  is reluctance, along with the desire to connect people to people to ﬁ nd answers, caused most of the 
partners to choose an approach that focused more on allowing people to indicate areas of interest and 
possible expertise, rather than on a formal designation.

Th  is approach had a number of beneﬁ ts: experts were not overburdened, anyone with experience or 
expertise could voluntarily provide it to a colleague, resources were not required to validate the answers, 
and many more people felt comfortable providing their areas of interest in proﬁ les in order to be helpful. 
Th  is dramatically increased the participation rate in ELS for the partners.

Th  e APQC study team found partners’ approaches to ELS fell into one or more of three diﬀ erent 

models depending on the objectives for the ELS.

Model One

Model one, linking knowledge providers and seekers, was the dominant model found in the study. As 
an example of this model, Honeywell’s perspective is that expertise location is about connecting people 
across a network, enabling collaboration, and getting assistance. Th  is orientation away from “experts” 
is characteristic of many partners and a major learning from the study. Intel also uses the terms “user or 
knowledge seeker” and “expert or knowledge provider.”

Key Points

Model One: The Knowledge Provider and Seeker Model–
Connecting People to People

•  Need: Find help or answers 
•  No a priori designation of “experts”
• 

“Experts” are usually volunteer knowledge providers who have information, 
expertise, or perspective that is useful to the current problem

• Reader discretion
• Choice
• Peer monitoring
• “An” answer is…

Model Two

Th  e second ELS model used by some of the partners involves staﬃ  ng projects and competency 
management. Because one of its goals is to understand the current and future skill needs of the 
organization, Northrop Grumman, as well as Rockwell Collins, based their ELS value proposition on 
the ability to map the current and future skills in the organization.

Model Two Example: Northrop Grumman

As an example of model two, XRef (the ELS system in Northrop Grumman) is a key tool in work 
force planning and discipline management. Discipline managers (functional area leaders) are responsible 
for knowing levels of expertise in their area of responsibility and planning for the future work force 
needs.

An important implication of knowing competencies is the ability to win business based on expertise. 
Northrop Grumman uses winning business or response time to a customer request as evidence of the 
value of the ELS.

Model Three

Th  e third model used by the partners involves designated experts. Intel and Schlumberger both 
designate experts as well as allow self-designated knowledge providers. Identiﬁ cation of Intel “experts” 
can occur in one of four ways:
• 
• 
• 
• 

employees designate themselves as experts in their ELS proﬁ le,
employees specify proﬁ ciency in a knowledge category,
a community assigns or nominates employees in any type of knowledge category, or
an organization assigns employees in any type of knowledge category.

Th  e means by which an expert is identiﬁ ed often reﬂ ects the degree of complexity of the knowledge to 
be shared. As one moves down the list above, the number of experts decreases signiﬁ cantly. Organization-
assigned experts are the most stringently evaluated and may own their process or have functional 
responsibility. Th  e designation may also be based on competency evaluation or subject matter expertise 
resulting from years of service, industry recognition, or academic credentials.

In Schlumberger, InTouch engineers, as well as other subject matter experts, are on call to respond 
to technical questions. In contrast, in the Eureka communities, participants often self-report their areas 
of interest and expertise and can choose to reply, or not, to an inquiry.

Key Points

Model Three: Designated Experts

•  Need: To have validated experts available to answer mission-critical questions
•  Approach: Management or functional groups assign experts
 
 

–  Air Products—designated safety experts

Th  e beneﬁ ts of self-reported expertise are clear. First, there are less privacy and legal concerns about 
sharing information about an employee when the employee has control over what is being shared. 
Second, less validation is required, and peer pressure tends to provide enough policing.

Key Points

Expertise Identiﬁ cation

•  All partners indicate that expertise is identiﬁ ed by self-report, in which 

individuals complete their own proﬁ les. Some partners have components of

Selecting a Model

Each partner had to decide what the purpose of the ELS was to be. For all of them, it was important 
that connecting people to people not be hindered by the validation of the expertise required to answer 
questions from a colleagues.

Key Points

Selecting a Model

•  Based on their experiences, the partners would give the following advice to 

 Before designing a system, ask “What is the real problem, need, or opportunity 
you are trying to address?”;
 Is designating experts going to address it?; and
If not, use the concept of a knowledge provider.

Best Practices in ELS

C H A P T E R   1

•  Allow people to voluntarily list their skills, expertise, and interests, and only 

designate experts in mission-critical or work ﬂ ow processes.
– 

 Voluntary control addresses many of the privacy concerns and laws.

 
•  Understand work process, needs, and culture before designing an ELS.
Is it a tool to ﬁ nd knowledgeable providers or experts? What is the culture?
 
•  Use a staged approach for design, implementation, and launch to reﬁ ne the 

– 

ELS process before expanding.
– 

It is possible to start small and inexpensively if you pick the right group.

 
•  Technology is a key enabler for scalability and to expand networks of contacts 

beyond the immediate community, function, or network.
–  ELS started manually and then expanded through automation.

 
•  Marketing, communication, and training were essential for participation.
•  Cross-functional representation is a characteristic of successful ELS design 

teams.
– 
– 

– 

 
 

 

 Cross-functional design teams ensure better designs and higher acceptance. 
 Use a cross-functional group of users to create the initial taxonomy of work 
processes and discipline domains.
 Link and leverage ELS by attaching the initiative to another accepted process or 
group of practitioners, such as the KM group.

•  Most business cases are based not on ﬁ nancial return, but on a compelling 
need to enable processes. Often, surveys were used to establish the need.

•  Use pilots for proof of concept and to reﬁ ne the approach.
 
•  Select a technology approach that ensures ongoing maintenance costs will be 

–  Design “global;” deploy locally (i.e., plan for expansion and scalability)

modest.

•  Establish measures from the beginning, through both usage and success 

stories.

Site Visit Partners’ ELS
Intel

Whereas Intel detailed a number of diﬀ erent ELS value propositions, the overall purpose and design 
of the ELS is to link employees with business problems to the ELS database. Once connected to the 
system, the user can browse his or her concern to perform a natural language search for existing people 
or solutions. If the search does not provide the sought-after information, then the user can query the 
system (an expert or a group of experts). Once an expert answers the question, the system automatically 
captures and stores the solution. In some instances, the system may share the solution with a subscriber 
base interested in the particular area of discussion.

Schlumberger

Schlumberger’s strategy for expertise location is part of their organic approach to knowledge 
management. Over time, in response to needs, four scenarios and approaches have emerged for 
identifying experts, each responding to a diﬀ erent context. Schlumberger does not have one ELS; it has 
four: the corporate directory, the Knowledge Hub, Eureka, and InTouch support. Each have related but 
distinct roles to play in expertise location. Th  e KM strategy has been to connect people to people through 
the directory, connect people to communities of practice through Eureka, connect people to information 
through the Hub, and connect people to best practices through InTouch. All of the four systems have 
an element in them that relates to expertise location. 

Schlumberger uses both “push” and “pull” strategies to increase the number of ELS users. Because 
the experts create directory records for themselves, they pull people toward them and are advertising 
themselves as publishers of content. Th  e system “pushes” by sending e-mail to groups created by the 
directory or bulletin boards.

Air Products

Th  e Air Products technology scouts try to ﬁ nd information that is not normally available. Th  ey do 
not duplicate the secondary research conducted by the library or anything published. A technology scout 
scours the “gray literature” for important advances and research that can be applied to in-house research 
eﬀ orts. Gray literature includes the Web sites of universities, research laboratories, government agencies, 
and journals not usually reviewed by researchers.

Technology scouts monitor 900 Web sites. If a newsworthy item appears, the scouts rewrite it into 
an alert and send it to the employees who have indicated in their proﬁ les that they are interested. Th  e 
technology scouts are located in the corporate technology evaluation and planning group and work 
closely with the KM team.

Key Points

Air Products’ Approach to ELS: Technology Scouting

•  Technical employees in R&D indicate in their proﬁ le the topics for which they 

would like to receive alerts.

•  A technology scout scours material not publicly published for important 
advances and research that can be applied to in-house research efforts.

•  When a scout ﬁ nds relevant information, he or she creates an alert in the ELS 

that contains:
–  a synopsis of the information,
– 
–  a link to the complete source (Web site, URL, or journal name, volume, and issue).

 
 
 
•  Scout searches the proﬁ les to ﬁ nd the people interested in the topic and/or 

the source of the information, and 

selects the appropriate distribution list from the ELS.

•  The ELS sends an e-mail to the people with a summary of the alert and a link to

Northrop Grumman employees use the XRef system to ﬁ nd someone with experience or expertise 
to help with a question or problem. A proﬁ le allows the reader to diﬀ erentiate skill levels by learning 
level and life experience. Employees provide a self-assessment of expertise on a scale of one to ﬁ ve, and 
the reader can view the projects on which the employee has worked.

          Lead engineers use XRef to ﬁ nd people who have worked on the projects earlier. Management 
uses it to keep track of the depth of employees’ capabilities and rapidly staﬀ  new programs, which can 
help win business. Anyone internal can use the system, including customers and suppliers if they are on 
the Northrop network.

          By using XRef as part of the talent pool, Northrop Grumman has cut the staﬃ  ng time for new

BUSINESS CASE AND INITIAL INVESTMENT

Intel is a good example of the ELS business case and funding process. Th  e Intel ELS team received 
approval from four business managers with cross-functional responsibilities to launch the pilot project. 
Th  ese business managers approved funding of $500,000, which came largely from the IT budget; and 
they were willing to allocate human resources to support the planning and launch of the pilot and 
provide their own associates to serve as constituents for the pilot project. 

Intel

Intel approved the enterprise license based on a ROI to recoup all costs in three years. Intel has a 
goal of 20,000 users (or half the estimated base) within three years. Th  e ROI calculation was made by 
assuming 10 hours per year per user, multiplied by an average salary of $25 per hour. Th  e ﬁ nance team 
conducted a more sophisticated analysis and completed computation to move the ROI through the 
approval phase by taking into account tax rates for savings and other details. Th  e headcount to support 
the system during production was fewer than three people. Th  ese individuals were tasked with product 
management, implementation, marketing, and value calculation. 

Key Points

Business Case

the source of the information, and 

that contains:
–  a synopsis of the information,
– 
–  a link to the complete source (Web site, URL, or journal name, volume, and issue).
For partners, the initial business case was based on user data and a 
compelling argument tied to the business strategy.
– 

 Several partners found that about 10 hours per week are spent searching for 
knowledge and expertise, which provided a time-saving rationale for the ELS.
 Intel’s ROI calculation was based on a three-year payback, which assumed a 
savings of 10 hours per year at $25/hour.

•  Pilots served as proof of concept for additional funding for expansion.
 

 Honeywell’s pilot results indicated that users could save 40 hours per year spent 
searching for information and people. ROI was calculated by multiplying by the 
number of users and the average cost per user.

C H A P T E R   1

Honeywell

Honeywell’s accepted ROI is greater than or equal to 12 percent and can be estimated using costs 
eliminated and costs avoided. Th  e savings were calculated from the baseline of 10 hours per week that 
employees use to search for information or for people who have the knowledge they need. Pilot results 
indicated that users could save 40 hours per year searching for information and people. Th  e team 
calculated the ROI by multiplying by the number of users and the average cost per user. Hard numbers, 
such as savings from problems avoided, were captured in the system through feedback mechanisms, but 
these numbers were harder to validate and attribute correctly. Th  ey were valuable as anecdotal support 
for the system.

INVESTMENT IN ELS

Th  e following examples involve investment and cost data for ELS design and implementation. 

•  Air Products’ investment for the initial manual ELS was only a few hundred dollars, with existing 
database software and four months of part-time eﬀ ort by one employee to collect and manage proﬁ les 
and distribute technology alerts. For the conversion to a Web-based ELS, Air Products spent $20,000 
for internal IT resources, one full-time programmer for ﬁ ve weeks, and two technology scouts to 
create and distribute alerts.

•  Honeywell explored and implemented its ELS in phases. Th  e ﬁ rst phase focused on the identiﬁ cation 
of the need, which required part-time eﬀ ort from two to three people, no formal budget, and about 
six weeks. During the planning phase, 10 to 15 people were involved part time for about four weeks 
in the cross-functional team, but the budget was still minimal (less than $5,000). During the pilot 
phase, 800 people participated; and the budget was approximately $100,000 (primarily for the 
culture study that preceded the pilot). Th  e pilot lasted for about 16 weeks.
Intel spent about $320,000 out of an approved budget of $500,000 for their exploration, 
development, and pilot phases.

Who Funds the ELS?

Funding for the ELS is primarily from the IT budget. None of the best-practice partners treat ELS 
as a stand-alone technology initiative; it is related to other knowledge management approaches. Four of 
the partners indicated that the KM core group has accountability for ELS and works with the IT team to 
determine how to proceed within the budget. Intel, Northrop Grumman, and Schlumberger indicated 
a shared responsibility across multiple groups, again with funding coming from the IT organization. 

All partners take a blended approach to operating on ELS by relating it to their KM initiatives. 
Honeywell’s ELS is the enabler of the collaboration eﬀ orts within and across group boundaries. In 
Intel, expertise location is part of ﬁ ve business cases: communities of practice, escalation/consultation, 
best-known practices, people directories, and business operation. In addition, as part of Intel’s content 
management system, experts are associated with online documents. Northrop Grumman’s KM group 
supports the use of XRef to provide product and project managers with information about personnel 
resources. Communities also use the resource. Air Products’ KM group champions the ELS as a corporate 
initiative. In Schlumberger, ELS is an element of several KM initiatives.

Key Points

Who Funds the ELS?

•  Most ELSs are designed, “owned,” and paid for by a corporate group, which is 

usually the IT organization.

 At Honeywell, maintenance of AskMe lies with the IT group for infrastructure-
related issues and with business units for expansion-related decisions. 
 At Intel, the ELS is owned and funded by the IT organization.
 Northrop Grumman’s KM team owns the core database. Human resources, 
business management, engineering, and production functions built the interfaces. 
Ongoing funding comes from IT.
 All four of the Schlumberger ELS components are owned by corporate IT, and 
they are funded centrally as part of corporate overhead. 
 In Air Products, technology scouts are part of the corporate technology 
group; KM provides coordination and oversight; IT provides funding for the 
infrastructure.

•  The KM organization provides thought leadership and monitors the initiative.
•  Business units are asked to provide endorsement and staff time.

Cross-functional Design Team

Elaborating on a cross-functional design team, both Honeywell and Intel had large, cross-functional 
teams. Intel team members represented cross-functional units and had diverse backgrounds. Two team 
members had previous ELS experience: one with another company and one with an earlier, unsuccessful 
ELS eﬀ ort at Intel. Th  e team was divided into a core team, a business team, and a technology team. 
Each had speciﬁ c responsibilities and deliverables. Th  e eﬀ orts of each team were carefully orchestrated 
to manage the critical paths of the overall project.

Th  e Honeywell team charter deﬁ ned deliverables, but also limited and deﬁ ned the scope to avoid 
unnecessary expansion into unrelated domains. Th  e initial charter of the Honeywell team was “to 
accelerate Honeywell productivity initiatives by enabling knowledge transfer from topic experts to 
knowledge seekers.” During a culture study, the charter shifted. Interviewees said they were not experts 
and would not sign up to be an “expert.” Th  e Honeywell team charter then changed from a focus on 
experts to a focus on knowledge providers.

Key Points

Characteristics of a Successful ELS Design

•  A critical success factor in successful design is understanding the culture of 
the target group, their work processes impacted by the ELS, and their needs.

Th  e purpose of the Honeywell team was to accomplish the following:
 prove the economic value of a people-to-people knowledge-sharing network for the corporation;
 reduce and eliminate redundant problem-solving, duplicated eﬀ orts, and overlapping projects; 
 hasten project execution through faster mobilization time and faster problem-solving;
 improve customer satisfaction levels and meet customers’ increasing performance demand levels;
 show (via anecdotal evidence) the inherent value of a knowledge-sharing network; and 
 help cultivate a culture of strong information sharing.

Th  e boundaries established for the team were to implement a pilot, measure results, recommend 
a company-wide strategy, use a Six Sigma methodology and stage-gate approach, and get broad 
representation.

Northrop Grumman and Air Products involved the business units and user groups in the technology 

and design process rather than having a cross-functional design team.

Stage-gates and Product Management

Both Intel and Honeywell used formal project management and design methodologies for their ELS 
design and deployment. Intel used its standardized project life cycle process with six distinct phases. 
Honeywell used a stage-gate approach.

Profile Maintenance

Proﬁ les need to be easy for users to create as well as maintain. Partners use automated processes 
whenever possible for populating a proﬁ le with demographic information and frequently use automated 
alerts to users to update their proﬁ les.

Understanding the Culture

Intel piloted the ELS to understand its cultural and behavioral impacts before launching the system 
enterprise wide. As a part of the pilot, value and behavior baseline surveys were deployed before and 
after the launch. Th  e surveys provided the team with insight into how speciﬁ c job codes would react to 
knowledge sharing and the value that the ELS might bring. Survey results showed dramatic diﬀ erences 
in the behavior of engineers compared to that of marketing personnel. Consequently, the team built 
ﬂ exibility into the system so that it could be modiﬁ ed and adapted to make each group feel comfortable 
and demonstrate the value of sharing knowledge.

C H A P T E R   1

On the advice of Intel, Honeywell also conducted an in-depth culture study prior to beginning their 
design process. Th  e ﬁ ndings from the culture study signiﬁ cantly impacted the system design. Honeywell 
uncovered the following information about the user group from the culture study.
•  People spend about 10 hours per week searching for information and people who have the right 

knowledge.

•  Th  e focus should be on connecting people, not just making information available.
•  Th  e success of the system depends on constant, visible executive and organizational support.
• 

Information providers need to be rewarded; and the most eﬀ ective reward is reciprocity, repute, and 
altruism.

•  Groups have diverse work styles and needs.
•  Th  e system needs to ﬁ t with employee’s current work ﬂ ow and tools.
•  Some employees are concerned about the repercussions of sharing what they know.
•  Some employees have preconceived perceptions from previous application roll outs.

Key Points

Understanding the Culture

•  Honeywell conducted an extensive cultural study of the pilot groups before 

launch. The results led them away from “expert” and to “knowledge provider.”
Intel conducted preliminary and post surveys, which led them to design 
different features for engineers and marketing staff.

Intel’s Project Life Cycle (PLC) Process

To guide the design of their ELS, Intel used their standardized project life cycle (PLC) process. 
Th  e process has six distinct phases. Using the foundation laid in the development phase, the Intel 
pilot phase engaged 1,200 users, populated the knowledge base, and cost approximately $320,000. An 
important deliverable of the pilot phase was the workbook, which contained more than 500 pages of 
documentation to support the decisions made throughout the completed phases, lessons learned, and 
collateral for future decisions.

Currently, Intel is in the early ramp-up phase. Th  ere are currently 3,000 users, and 5,000 are expected 
by the end of 2003. Th  e goal is to have 20,000 active users of AskMe (out of 40,000 targeted potential 
users) by 2006. (Intel has 80,000 employees.)

•  Most partner organizations have a process for automatic alerts to encourage 

people to update their proﬁ les. Honeywell does not.

•  When an employee leaves, the proﬁ le is hidden, but the searches and

Profile Maintenance: Taxonomy

Intel and Schlumberger have controlled vocabularies in use for proﬁ les and the ELS. For Intel, 
a critical piece of the development process was building the knowledge content into the taxonomy 
backbone and knowledge category systems. Th  e backbone was based on the taxonomy employed by the 
Intel library. Th  is backbone was tested in interviews with 20 experts across 16 divisions. Th  e moderator 
develops speciﬁ c categories during and following the training sessions. A moderator is responsible for 
category maintenance and can change subcategory words up to (but not including) the highest level

participation in the ELS voluntary and allowing employees to approve all content displayed.

Key Points

Best Practices: Privacy Policies

•  Make participation voluntary: provide users with levels of security, privacy, 

and control to increase participation.
– 

 

 Privacy concerns can be overcome by making sharing voluntary and providing 
user control over what is displayed in their proﬁ le.

•  Adopt privacy, use, and liability rules currently enforced for e-mail.
Involve the legal and human resource departments in these decisions.
• 
•  Distinguish between paranoia and legitimate concerns when designing 

safeguards.

Key Points

How Partners Adhere to Privacy Laws

•  Air Products—Participation in the ELS is strictly voluntary. All information in 

the system is provided by the individuals, who maintain their own proﬁ les. 
Individuals can change or delete the information in their proﬁ les at any time.

•  Eli Lilly—Employees can opt out, which hides data to all except owner 

(employee) and human resources.

•  Honeywell—Participation is voluntary. 
• 
•  Rockwell Collins—Adheres through controlled access and has no personal 

Intel—Adheres by training and auditing against e-mail standards.

information and no “protected class” of information. 

•  Northrop Grumman—Found that most privacy issues were moot and were 

based on fear and misperceptions.

C H A P T E R   1

Example: Intel’s Approach to Privacy and Security

Th  e Intel ELS adheres to company security and privacy rules. Because use is voluntary and users 
are warned that they are involved at their own risk, Intel has not encountered any issues or constraints. 
When an audit uncovers potential issues or violations, the support team or moderators contact the user 
directly and ask him or her to resolve the problem. In all cases, the user has resolved the problem quickly 
and without issue. In a severe instance, the security team would be contacted to resolve the issue. Th  e 
Intel partner proﬁ le provides more detail on how Intel addresses security and privacy questions.

Key Points

Example: Intel’s Approach to Privacy and Security

Privacy
•  Users share what they want to share.
•  User applies the knowledge in ELS at his/her own risk.
•  Content must comply with company privacy policy.
•  The support team and/or moderator audit content periodically.
•  The disclaimer is available/accessible during training, log in, and newsletter.

Individual conversations or a knowledge category can be locked.

Security 
•  Encryption is applied wherever it is mandated by company.
• 
•  Content must comply with the company’s security policy.
•  The support team and/or moderator audit content periodically.
•  The disclaimer is accessible during training, log in, and in the newsletter.

Example: Honeywell’s Privacy Policy

For the ELS, Honeywell applies the same rules already in place for e-mail in Honeywell. Th  e legal 

department has approved these policies.

Key Points

Example: Honeywell’s Privacy Policy

•  Participation is voluntary.
•  All foreign nationals are tagged to allow their activity to be audited by the legal 

department.

•  Any question can be marked “private” at any time, which takes it out of public 

view. Any section can be authorized as “entry-only” and/or as a restricted 
view.

•  Knowledge network did not get “special treatment.” It is no different than 

e-mail. The same guidelines apply.

•  Security is maintained by corporate LDAP, with employee ID numbers used for 

access.

•  Europe was not treated differently because of the voluntary nature of the ELS 

application.

costs to Design and Launch

c h a p t e r   1

Partners were not at liberty to provide the APQC study group with detailed cost figures for their 
software purchases. Based on their reports, it appears that total costs of design and launch varied 
greatly. 

At the high end of investment, the Intel ELS project team had a budget of $500,000, and the team 
consisted of seven people who dedicated 30 percent of their work time to developing and launching 
the ELS. When the team was convened, Intel had already made the decision to roll out the ELS 
enterprisewide, but the team focused on the group and/or community level for the pilot phase.

At the low end of initial investment, Air Products began their ELS as a grassroots effort, with one 
person dedicated part time to interviewing 100 technology specialists on the kinds of information and 
alerts they would like to receive. There was no formal budget, and alerts were manually sent. Greater 
investment was required in later years when the technology alerts were automated, but the investment 
was based on using internal staff time and not purchasing software. 

(Detailed descriptions of the design process, resources, and roles may be found in each of the partner 

profiles.)

Key Points

costs to Design and Launch

•  Some partners took a very low cost approach to ELS.
 

 Air Products began with a manual process and then used internal IT resources to 
automate it.

– 

• 

Intel’s, Honeywell’s and Schlumberger’s approaches were more expensive 
but also had a more extensive set of enterprise-wide objectives and were 
supporting much larger groups of staff.

•  Partners were not at liberty to share their software costs. Applications and 
technology appear to be the smallest costs in ELS. The bigger costs are for 
staff or consultant time in order to understand users’ requirements, build those 
requirements into the launch plans, and communicate and market the system 
to users.

Examples of ELS-specific Roles

At Intel, moderators are individuals with a broad base of business and/or technical knowledge and 
operational skills. Th  ey work with the implementation manager or champion to deﬁ ne, set up, and 
maintain knowledge categories for the business group. Th  ese people “own” the knowledge category where 
they act as moderators and are responsible for maintaining the local taxonomy within the context of the 
larger Intel taxonomy, which is more controlled.

In Air Products, technology scouts are information specialists with technical training who provide 

technologists with alerts on interesting ﬁ ndings or research.

TOP ISSUES IN ELS TECHNOLOGY

Th  e term “expertise locator system” is relatively new in the software industry. Employee directories, 
on the other hand, have been around for a long time. Th  e term “directories” refers to a list of names that 
contains speciﬁ c information about an individual such as his or her title, role, manager, and department. 
In most organizations, these directories are maintained by human resources personnel to keep a current 
list of employees at an organization.

Some organization’s have considerably expanded the use of these directories to list employee skills or 
interest areas in an eﬀ ort to promote communication and knowledge sharing among employees. Th  ese 
enhanced directories are the simplest form of expertise locator systems. 

Until early 2000, however, an enhanced expertise locator system was not yet available as a software 
product. Some organizations may have used existing vendors to expand their applications to incorporate 
expertise location functionality; but as a whole, no ELS applications existed. Th  erefore, organizations 
such as Air Products decided to build their functionality in-house in order to enable them to promote 
knowledge sharing across their organization.

Th  e decision to build a custom system from scratch or to buy an oﬀ -the-shelf product has always 
plagued technical teams. Building systems used to be the only choice. When an organization needed 
new functionality, it either charged its programmers to build it or hired outside technical help to get it 
done. Building from scratch is no longer the norm. With plug-and-play applications now available in 
the marketplace, organizations are opting to purchase oﬀ -the-shelf software in order to save time and 
money and to get functional quickly.

Build Versus Buy Decision

C H A P T E R   2

Technical factors to consider in a build-or-buy decision1 follow.

•  Review the current in-house technical infrastructure.
•  Do any of the in-house systems have a component that could support some of the functionality you 

are looking for?

• 

•  Does your existing infrastructure allow you to add new functionality to it that would be compatible 

with your ELS requirements?
If you chose to build on an existing application, will it integrate with other applications? For example, 
an organization may chose to build an ELS system on its existing portal application, but it may not 
integrate with its human resources application, which creates duplicative employee records.

•  What is the cost to develop the in-house application? Remember cost includes time, money, and 

people.

Change management factors to consider follow.

•  How long have existing systems been in place? It is always diﬃ  cult to get employees to use a new 

system when existing systems are ingrained in an employee’s work ﬂ ow.

•  Can you manage scope creep? Building a software application is like building a house. Th  e general 
feeling is to add new features as they come about. Th  e attitude is: “we are building this from scratch, 
and we might as well get it in there.” Th  e hidden danger there is the system will take longer to build, 
will be more costly, and in the end may lack technical integrity if functionality is built in pieces.

Key Points

Build Versus Buy Decision

Guidelines to help make the decision
•  Deﬁ ne high-level user requirements.
•  Break into long-term, medium-term, and immediate needs.
•  Classify needs by priority: high, medium, and low.
•  Get stakeholder agreement.
•  Estimate time, effort, and resources required for the different options.
• 
•  Create a ﬂ ow-chart to help make a decision.

List all options, and rank according to priority and needs.

Types of Solutionns

C H A P T E R   2

Th  ere are three types of ELS solutions: packaged, custom, and hybrid.
Potential beneﬁ ts of the three types of solutions follow.

•  Package solutions–software may be of better quality of and higher integrity if it has all been thought 

out well and built on a solid foundation.

•  Custom solution–the major beneﬁ t is customization. Th  e software can do exactly what you want it 
to do. Th  ere are no licensing costs on an annual basis. However, those are typically a wash with costs 
incurred for upgrading the application for new functionality.

•  Hybrid solution–this approach can provide a little bit of both beneﬁ ts: the structure of an existing 

system and the customization beneﬁ ts of extending the application.

Potential pitfalls of the three types of solutions follow.

•  Across the board, the potential pitfall is the quality and relationship with the vendor. Regardless of 
whether the application is purchased, built, or integrated, an unqualiﬁ ed vendor will signify trouble 
later.

•  Oﬀ -the-shelf software applications typically carry an 18 percent to 20 percent annual licensing 

cost.

•  Speciﬁ cally for the custom solution, hidden costs are a major pitfall. Many little customizations add 

up to a large eﬀ ect on time to deploy and total development costs.

•  Because a hybrid solution involves some customization, it is prone to suﬀ er from the symptoms of 
scope creep and excessive costs. A hybrid solution also consists of oﬀ -the-shelf software, so it will 
carry the same 18 percent to 20 percent annual licensing costs per application.

Key Points

Types of Solutions

•  Packaged solution–refers to a complete or nearly complete solution proposed 

by a vendor for ELS functionality.

• 

•  Custom solution–refers to a customized solution built from scratch based on 

the organization’s needs.
Intermediate/Hybrid solution–refers to a solution that consists of a 
combination of various packages integrated with custom code to enable 
them to work together. An intermediate solution may also consist of a custom 
solution built on an organization’s existing software application.

Th  e slide below details the decisions of Honeywell to buy and Air Products to build. Th  e decisions 

of the other three best-practice partners are described below.
• 

Intel–the Intel team selected AskMeTM based on user requirements. Th  e decision was primarily 
based on the fact that Intel could not cost-eﬀ ectively build all the functionality for the price that it 
could buy the software.

•  Northrop Grumman–a combination of several solutions support expertise location. Xref, Tacit, and 
Engineum are primary components. Xref is an in-house, custom-built application that started 
small and has grown because of demand and use across the organization. Tacit and Engineum were 
purchased to add more value to expertise location by providing proﬁ les of employee knowledge 
and skills gleaned from e-mail communication, as well as powerful search capabilities to help locate 
documents and their subsequent owners.

•  Schlumberger–Schlumberger is a technology-intensive organization, so the tendency has always 
been to build applications in-house. Schlumberger’s ELS is built on LDAP technology. However, 
Schlumberger is looking for packaged solutions for the future because it is anticipating increased 
usage and global demands on the system.

LESSONS LEARNED—BUILD VERSUS BUY DECISION

Key Points

Build Versus Buy Decision

Factors will change during the decision-making process.

• 
•  Make a good decision based on what you know. It will not always be the best 

decision.

•  Taking too much time to decide will have long-term repercussions on your 

project and the organization.

•  With custom, purchase, or hybrid projects, use an iterative process. Build a 

little, review, match against requirements and outcomes, and make changes if 
necessary.

SELECTING A VENDOR

What capabilities do most of these vendors oﬀ er?

Platform or Functionality that Supports Collaboration
•  Vendor facilitates informal ﬂ ow of information.
•  Vendor provides a workspace for interaction so that it can monitor activity and look for experts in 

•  Typically, collaborative spaces do not allow for distinction between levels of expertise unless 

topic areas.

speciﬁ cally customized to do so.

Directory or Profile Listing
•  Vendor provides the ability to create a proﬁ le of an employee.
•  Typically, demographic information is automatically drawn from an HR or ERP system. Th  is system 
allows more “descriptive” information to be gathered on the employee such as past experience, past 
projects worked on, skills, areas of expertise, interests, and availability to work abroad.

Database or Repository of Content
•  An ELS provides the capability to store content. Th  is is critical when systems are set up to ﬁ rst look 
at existing information to ﬁ nd answers to questions posed by employees before ﬁ nding a person to 
answer it.

•  Th  e repository will typically come with an OEM search engine that will enable full-text searches.

Expertise Locator Systems: Finding the Answers  •  ©2003 APQC

55

C H A P T E R   2

Scanning information
•  Diﬀ erent from searching in a repository, scanning information to ﬁ nd expertise includes scanning 
content as well as e-mail. These systems automatically build expertise profiles based on the 
information an individual writes or shares on a daily basis.

Reporting modules
•  Vendors provide the ability to print activity reports, or proﬁ les, skill lists, etc.

Open platform to build on
• 

It has almost become expected that all software today provide platforms that organizations can 
build on, independent of the software organization itself. If the software is written in proprietary 
language and the vendor does not allow open API standards or provide software developer kits, then 
the purchaser is severely restricted to using only the original vendor for further development. Such 
requirements have become unacceptable in the software industry.

Vendor Selection Process

C H A P T E R   2

When selecting a vendor, take the following factors into consideration:

•  Payback for your organization—the application addresses enough capabilities to allow you to show a 

changed or a new process and maybe even some payback as outlined in your business case.

•  Current functionality offered by vendor—do not get caught in the “coming soon” trap that some 

• 

vendors will subject you to once they know your requirements.
Extendibility of application—do not pay heed to what the vendor says it will oﬀ er in the future but to 
whether the platform will allow you to extend the application if you chose to.

•  Consulting support—most vendors should provide expert support. Th  eir consultants are more 
expensive than an integrator, but they typically require less time to address an issue and know the 
application better than some integrators.

•  Other factors—these are factors that you may have outlined in your build-or-buy ﬂ owchart, such as 
the ability to integrate the application with existing resources, or vendor-speciﬁ c factors such as 24/7 
global support for your employees.

Key Points

Vendor Selection Process

•  Determine the overall outcome of the expertise locator system.
•  Conduct a needs assessment, and create a list of needs.
•  Develop a list of potential vendors based on needs expressed by users and 

some initial marketplace research.

•  Develop a vendor assessment questionnaire and request that the vendors ﬁ ll it 

out.

•  Assess the risks associated with each vendor.
•  Assess the vendor based on the user’s needs and the vendor’s capabilities to 

deliver those needs, and create a summary document.

•  Make a decision.

C H A P T E R   2

Integration Points for ELS

Integration with existing systems is a critical success factor for expertise locator systems for two 
reasons. First, if the expertise locator system is implemented as a stand-alone system and is not designed 
to be part of an individual’s work process, then employees’ participation will likely be low. Secondly, the 
basic information for an expertise locator system almost always exists in a human resources database or 
employee directory of some kind, and it is important to leverage or reuse the data that already exists.

Because expertise implies skills and experience in a particular area, integration with performance 
management systems and project staﬃ  ng systems seems to be a natural extension and exists at four of 
the seven partner systems studied.

Integration with e-mail systems and document repositories exists in organizations where the ELS is 
designed to crawl or search those systems to automatically generate an expertise proﬁ le for an individual 
based on either the e-mail that he/she is sending out or the documents that an individual may have 
authored.

Instant messaging/chat is primarily used as a vehicle to provide a response to a query. Instant 
messaging carries some expectations with it. Th  e requestor will expect an almost immediate reply. For 
the experts involved it means a diﬀ erent level of commitment than answering an e-mail within 24 to 
48 hours. Norms such as setting a user name to show “out-to-lunch” or “be back in a few” are very 
important. Another issue that should be considered is that of ﬁ nding someone else to answer the question 
if the original knowledge provider is not available.

Linking ELS with Other Systems

C H A P T E R   2

All partners link their ELS with other in-house systems. Here are some examples.

•  Northrop Grumman—ELS is linked to human resources, performance management, and active 

directory.

•  Schlumberger—LDAP, SAP, and human resources are all linked together. Th  ere is a separate human 
resources proﬁ le for oﬃ  cial use, and there is a career networking proﬁ le for communication and 
knowledge-sharing purposes.

•  Rockwell Collins—ELS is linked to performance review systems, learning and development systems, 

and engineering and resource planning systems.

Key Points

Linking ELS with Other Systems

All partners link their ELS with other in-house systems.
•  Air Products–the ELS is linked to central employee directory (“Workforce”).
•  Eli Lilly–the ELS is linked to communities of practice, succession management, 

and performance management.

•  Honeywell–has a planned (not implemented) link to in-house project tracking 

• 

application and Siebel customer relationship management system.
Intel–individual records are extracted from the human resources database. 
The ELS is also linked to MS Outlook, MS Share Point Server, and instant 
messaging.

Search Capabilities

Key Points

Search Capabilities

•  Whether you are looking for people or content, it is essential that employees 

• 

• 

• 

• 

be able to locate them.
If an employee cannot identify an expert or knowledge provider, then they can 
not contact one.
If an employee can not locate the appropriate documents, then more of the 
provider’s time is spent attempting to answer questions.
In a best-case scenario, one search function scans all applicable repositories 
or listings.
In a best-practice partner example, Schlumberger has an integrated search 
capability that looks across a variety of databases in response to a query.

ELS FTE Maintenance Requirements are Modest

Maintenance requirements for Air Products follow.

•  KM group staﬃ  ng: eight employees are assigned to the KM Center of Excellence, and about 40 

others are part-time contributors and facilitators throughout the world.

•  Th  e ELS is maintained by a 0.1 FTE administrator and 0.25 IT support staﬀ .
•  A clerical staﬀ  sends alerts: 1.2 FTE.

CHARACTERISTICS OF A SUCCESSFUL ELS LAUNCH

Key Points

Characteristics of a Successful ELS Launch

•  Begin the launch with a pilot whenever possible. 
 

– 

 All of the partners began in units where the sponsorship and desire to have the 
solution were present.
 Expansion also reﬂ ected a “pull” approach, which is encouraged by marketing 
the system to potential user groups.

 

– 

•  A formal marketing and communications plan leads to greater participation 

and usage.

•  Don’t lose the human touch.
 
 

– 
– 

 Honeywell’s team sent hand-written thank-you notes to advocates.
 Northrop Grumman asked early adopters to identify success stories and 
encourage others to add their proﬁ les.
 Intel recognizes people for participation and for advocacy.

VALUE OF PILOTS

Honeywell selected a pilot group that shared a business goal, was oriented toward sharing, and 
wanted  the ELS. Additional criteria for the pilot group included a driven, knowledgeable group that was 
cross-company, cross-area, cross-functional, had the right mindset, and was enthusiastic. Th  e Six Sigma 
pilot group was focused on delivering productivity results to Honeywell.

C H A P T E R   3

Key Points

Value of Pilots

•  Use pilots to understand the local culture and work ﬂ ow of the potential users 

 
 

in order to intimately embed the solution into their process. 
– 
– 

 Intel piloted with 1,200 people over a 10-month period.
 Honeywell piloted with the Six Sigma and customer service groups over a four-
month period.

•  Pilots provide the proof of concept to build the business case for moving 

forward.

•  Selection of a pilot that is already cross-functional, such as Six Sigma 

champions, gave Honeywell a “touch point” across many functional areas.

Intel’s Pilots

Th  e Intel team kicked oﬀ  marketing campaigns and rewards and recognition programs in conjunction 
with the launch of the pilot. Th  e team gauged the success of the campaigns and programs over the course 
of the eﬀ ort.

Intel successfully completed the pilot phase in 10 months. Th  e team evaluated the success of the 
project by measuring it against the requirements (schedule, budget, usage, performance indicators, and 
ROI) and customers’ feedback. Th  e team saw a 13-week upward rolling trend for the number of log-ins 
and the number of knowledge exchanges. Had these requirements not been met, the pilot may not have 
been judged a success and the project could have been halted.

Intel’s pilot also revealed an important design tip: every additional click required will reduce 10 

percent to 20 percent of the users who will actually use the system.

Key Points

Intel’s Pilots

Encourage Participation

C H A P T E R   3

Key Points

Encouraging Participation

•  Having a well-thought-out communication and launch plan leads to faster 

adoption and participation.
In addition to a formal set of communications, Intel used a calculated 
“infection model” by encouraging word-of-mouth promotion, company-wide 
advertising, and Web site referral.

• 

•  Several partners offered training programs:
 

–  Certiﬁ cation of moderators, online training, and train the trainer

Encouraging Participation: Incentives and Rewards

What motivates partner employees to complete their proﬁ les is diﬀ erent for each partner, but 
all rely on the personal beneﬁ t to the employee. If Air Products’ employees wish to receive targeted 
technology alerts, then they have to complete and update their proﬁ les. Eli Lilly, Rockwell Collins, 
Schlumberger, and Northrop Grumman all include a proﬁ le review in the performance review. At 
Northrop Grumman, proﬁ le creation is part of the employee annual review process, and a measure in the 
semiannual performance review process. Th  e ELS required the employee to enter a minimum amount 
of data, and other data are voluntarily entered. 

In Honeywell and Intel, the chance to give advice and be seen as knowledgeable and helpful by 
peers and management is a key motivator. Th  e Intel ELS recognition program has four levels and is 
designed to motivate participation through recognition. Th  e reward is largely to provide recognition, 
but in some cases, a community or functional group may decided to provide small rewards such as $25 
to $50, American Express gift certiﬁ cates, or Intel logo merchandise. Intel, as a rule, does not encourage 
cash gifts for KM recognition because Intel’s culture does not ﬁ nd that, in the long term, these ad hoc 
ﬁ nancial rewards promote the desired behavior.

Best Practices in ELS Measures and Metrics

Key Points

Best Practices in ELS Measures and Metrics

• 

If purchasing a tool, ask the vendor for measures that others have used and 
then select and adapt for your situation.

•  Several partners make a distinction between usage and success metrics.
•  Establish a process for ﬁ nding and reporting success stories.
•  Conduct preliminary and post-implementation surveys of user satisfaction.
 

 It is equally important to track the number of questions answered as it is to track 
the quality ratings of content in speciﬁ c areas.

Identifying and Selecting ELS Measures

C H A P T E R   4

Identifying appropriate measures early in the ELS implementation cycle was identiﬁ ed as a critical 
success factor for partner organizations. Th  e approaches adopted by partner organizations to select 
measures ranged from highly sophisticated Six Sigma procedures to measuring ELS usage and acceptance 
among subscribers. Honeywell, for instance, gathered all the measures ever used in an ELS technical 
implementation before selecting their own. Th  e measures were internal Honeywell measures as well 
as measures supplied by the vendor. Th  e pool of measures was subjected to a rigorous analysis using 
Six Sigma tools such as Quality Functional Deployment, PMAP, and FMEA to determine the which 
measures to pick. Th  e eﬀ ort resulted in 10 success metrics and seven usage metrics, which are described 
later in this section.

Air Products and Chemicals, on the other hand, decided to select measures based on the core 
functionality of their ELS, which was the dissemination of news alerts to employees. Th  eir measures 
include how many employees are signed up for alerts and whether or not they ﬁ nd them useful (as judged 
by a survey).

Schlumberger’s expertise location functionality is dispersed over several systems such as the 
Hub (knowledge repository), InTouch (engineering help desk), Eureka (community of scientists 
and engineers), and its Career Networking Proﬁ les (CNP). Measures for the Hub and the InTouch 
communities are very rigorous. Th  e usage metrics are used to assess future training needs for employees. 
Th  e measures on the CNPs, however, are not as rigorous. Activity measures, such as number of proﬁ les 
created and updated, are available for members to view online.

Two Types of Measures

APQC’s KM Measurement Framework (introduced in the 2003 Best-practice Report Measuring 
the Impact of Knowledge Management from APQC) recommends tracing KM investments (inputs), 
activities (process and behaviors) to impacts (outputs), and related bottom-line measures (outcomes). 
Successful KM initiatives show a linkage between inputs, activities, and outcomes. Th  e partners in this 
study focused on inputs and activity measures, and gauged usage and satisfaction as output measures

Value and ROI measures refer to the calculation of input (typically dollars spent), minus outcome 
(typically dollars saved) to provide the hard numbers to support the success of the program. ROI is often 
calculated based on the total cost of ownership of the system and includes the costs associated with initial 
setup and ongoing analysis of the system. For the ELS support team, it includes ongoing support and 
technology costs.

Th  e Intel team conducts quantitative analysis on a variety of fronts and frequently communicates 
results to key stakeholders to build support and engage potential user groups. A weekly report termed 
the “usage summary” presents the number of knowledge categories and subcategories, number of unique 
users and proﬁ les, questions and answers provided that week with the percentage rated, and the number 
of search and browsing activities. Th  e team tracks key user/usage indicators and includes the average “per 
production per user per month” and the “return user” rate. Success stories and anecdotes captured online 
through feedback mechanisms or champions are gathered as qualitative indicators of success.

Intel: Pilot Measures and Results

One of the critical success factors of ELS implementation, especially a large-scale implementation, 
has been to identify the appropriate measures during the pilot phase and show some results. Two partners, 
Honeywell and Intel, did just that. Th  e pilots were a complete prototype of the solution including usage 
and success measures. Th  e only limitation was the degree to which the system had been rolled out in the 
organization.

During the pilot phase, the Intel implementation team established success indicators to monitor the 
pilot. An interesting observation for Intel was not the response time or the quality of the answers. It was 
the low number of questions being asked. Th  e team had to consequently work on encouraging employees 
to ask questions so that experts could answer them.

Honeywell: Measures and Results

Measures and results are important in Honeywell’s culture and played a key role in the stage-gate 
process employed by the ELS team. One of two sub-teams focused on measures and results. Th  e team 
used the Six Sigma DMAIC process and tools to identify and select its measures. Th  e team adjusted and 
ﬁ ne-tuned communications and strategies based on emerging data patterns. 

Th  e team identiﬁ ed 10 success metrics and seven usage metrics that could be used to manage the 
project. Although many other metrics were and are tracked, these were identiﬁ ed as the “critical few.” 
Usage metrics served as leading indicators of performance and were updated on a more frequent basis 
(daily, multiple times per day) as compared to the success metrics. Metrics are tracked using a weekly 
scorecard for both “success metric” tracking and “usage metric” tracking.

Honeywell categorizes its business drivers and results by responsiveness, agility, eﬀ ectiveness, and 

productivity.
•  Responsiveness–Answers to questions must be in minutes and hours, not days. Twenty-four hours 

is the average.

•  Agility–More than 90 percent of the connections or answers come from across boundaries 

• 

(organizational, geographical, and divisional).

Other Less Quantifiable Benefits of ELS
•  Honeywell, Air Products, and Intel were especially pleased that the systems enabled expertise sharing 

across normal organizational boundaries.

•  At Northrop Grumman, the ELS enables the retention of valuable knowledge and project staﬃ  ng 
options by including an extended network of contractors and retirees—whoever is in the ﬁ rewall. 

•  Legitimize participation and success stories as evidence of value.

Just Because Knowledge Is Intangible Does Not Mean That Its Impact Is

 Th  e overarching lesson learned is this: if one can’t ﬁ gure out how to measure the impact of KM on the 
business, it is a clue that one doesn’t understand how the KM approach actually is going to work. And that 
is a clue that it probably won’t (unless you get lucky). It is time to go back and get it right.

LESSONS LEARNED

All the partners cited change management issues as both the reasons for their success and where they 
learned the most lessons. Behavior change was diﬃ  cult for all partners. Many reported that people forget 
that the ELS is available or do not attend to its introduction. At Honeywell, even people who wanted 
to use the system accidentally deleted their launch instructions, thinking it was SPAM. Implementers 
should carefully choose the wording in the subject line of the message that introduces the system so that 
the recipient knows it contains instructions. Intel’s ELS team believes that its marketing plan and ongoing 
communications and recognition were key promotional tools to remind people to use the system.

For Honeywell, critical success factors in the ELS included the culture study, the paradigm shift 
to “knowledge provider” rather than “expert,” excellent communications, the selection of the right 
pilot group (Six Sigma), and the selection of the right metrics and vendor. Conversely, Honeywell 
reported that the ELS team would have liked to have been more pervasive in communication, eﬀ ectively 
embedding the ELS in the work process,and having more patience because behavior change takes time 
in a large company.

During the deployment of its ELS, Air Products identiﬁ ed four critical success factors based on its 
lessons learned. First of all, tie the ELS to an existing business process. In the company, new initiatives 
and processes are often perceived negatively. By tying it into an existing process (technology alerts) 
that is seen as valuable by employees, the team immediately generated a supportive following for the 
ELS. Second, give people a vested interest in posting and maintaining proﬁ les. Collaboration and the 
opportunity to receive new information on topics of interest is a motivator, and the price of admission 
is completing and updating a proﬁ le. Th  ird, the ELS needs both bottom-up and top-down support to 
expand to the enterprise. Th  e organic growth of the system in its early years built a very strong foundation 
in a pivotal user group. However, in order to gain the credibility and acceptance of the enterprise, more 
executive support (the KM group) was needed. Finally, keep the system low maintenance. Th  e more 
maintenance costs required for systems, the higher the likelihood it will be a target for budget cuts. 
Keeping the system simple and easy to use not only increases the user experience, but also allows it to 
“ﬂ y under the (budget-cutting) radar.”

Senior executive sponsorship was cited by several partners as a key need for expansion. Most employ 
a marketing approach to spreading the use of an ELS (rather than by mandate); and unless the executives 
in a potential unit endorse the system and role model its use, it is hard to propagate.

Schlumberger and others cited “ease of use” as a major lesson learned as they developed their ELS 
applications over a period of years. Th  e proﬁ les need to be easy to maintain—a change in one application 
should automatically propagate to others—and competing systems need to be removed to reduce 
confusion. As an organization that built its original systems, Schlumberger stresses that IT standards 
are needed to promote compatibility of the systems. If the company were starting today, then it would 
purchase commercial components that were well integrated.

Air Products and Chemicals Inc.

Air Products and Chemicals Inc. serves customers worldwide in technology, energy, health care, 

and industrial markets with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions by providing 
atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials, and chemical intermediates. Th  e 
company is a leading global supplier of electronic materials, hydrogen, helium, and select performance 
chemicals. Founded in 1940, Air Products has annual revenues of $5.4 billion, operations in more than 
30 countries, and 17,200 employees. 

Air Products and Chemicals provides gases such as argon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen to 
manufacturers, health care facilities, petroleum reﬁ ners, semiconductor producers, and other industries. 
It also produces chemicals including catalysts, surfactants, and intermediates used to make polyurethane, 
amines, and emulsions derived from vinyl acetate monomer (VAM). Air Products also makes gas 
containers and equipment that separates air, puriﬁ es hydrogen, and liqueﬁ es gas.

Air Products and Chemicals distributes industrial gases by building on-site plants (a strategy nearly 
as old as the company itself) or by truck for companies with less extensive needs. Customers include AK 
Steel Holding Corp., Samsung Corp., the Sherwin-Williams Co., and many major petroleum reﬁ ners 
and chemical companies.

Th  e company broadened its health care operations in late 2002 by acquiring American Homecare 
Supply Co., which serves the home health care industry. It also moved to strengthen its electronics 
business by acquiring the electronic chemicals division of Ashland Specialty Chemical in June 2003 for 
$300 million. Th  e unit provides chemicals to the semiconductor industry. Air Products and Chemicals 
spends approximately 2 percent of sales on research and development.

OVERVIEW OF ELS

Establishing a need for an ELS was a grassroots eﬀ ort. An employee from the technology group 
championed its ﬁ rst deployment in the early 1990s as a solution to link external technology development 
to internal needs. Th  e technology group explored all of its options before implementing ELS. Th  e 
champion interviewed more than 100 potential users to develop preliminary proﬁ les and kept the 
proﬁ les in a spreadsheet. He then collected and disseminated unpublished external technology research 
and shared it with interested parties in hard copy by matching the news items to the proﬁ les. Th  irteen 
years later, information delivery methods have matured signiﬁ cantly, but the basic sharing processes are 
still in place.

Although ELS predates Air Products and Chemical’s knowledge management (KM) initiative, it has 
recently been incorporated under the KM umbrella. KM had existed as an informal organization since 
1999 and became the basis for the Center of Excellence, the formal KM group established in 2001. Th  e 
KM group is a virtual organization staﬀ ed by eight to 10 full-time equivalents (FTEs). An additional 

Expertise Locator Systems: Finding the Answers  •  ©2003 APQC

91

A I R   P R O D U C T S

50+ people are aﬃ  liated with KM by virtue of the work that they do, and they commit varying levels 
of eﬀ ort to the Center of Excellence. In 2002 the ELS was adopted as an enterprise KM oﬀ ering and 
brought under management of the Center of Excellence.

Today, Air Products and Chemicals has a Web-based ELS housed on the corporate intranet. Th  e 
current version was commissioned in 1998 and built in-house because no oﬀ -the-shelf products met the 
users’ needs at the time. Th  e organization upgrades the system annually and has considered migrating to 
an oﬀ -the-shelf application but has not found one that cost eﬀ ectively meets the organization’s needs. 
Members of an ELS-focused group that scan for information are called “technology scouts.” Th  ey are 
part of the corporate technology evaluation and planning group, which reports to the chief technology 
oﬃ  cer. Th  e information technology personnel who support the system are members of technical data 
systems, an R&D computing group that reports through the corporate research services department to 
the chief technology oﬃ  cer. Because KM is a cross-functional organization, it adds signiﬁ cant credibility 
and visibility to ELS eﬀ orts and provides a network of people to promote ELS beneﬁ ts throughout the 
enterprise. 

Virtually everyone in Air Products and Chemicals has access to ELS, but the KM group targets 
approximately 12,000 potential users. ELS currently has almost 2,400 active users, of which about 800 
are in the R&D organization. Retirees and joint venture partners are the only groups speciﬁ cally excluded 
from system use. ELS is used mostly for technology alerts, but the user base is increasing and is starting 
to use ELS in other areas such as communities of practice, sales, marketing, information technology, 
engineering, one-on-one collaboration, and mentoring. 

Technology scouts generate technology alerts and use the ELS to identify the right people and to 
disseminate the alert. Technology scouting forms the basis of the ﬁ rst ELS champion’s role and has 
evolved today to approximately two FTEs under the R&D umbrella, with virtual membership in the KM 
chief operating executive. Scouts scour the “gray” literature for important advances and information that 
can be applied to in-house research eﬀ orts. Gray literature includes the Web sites of universities, research 
laboratories, and government agencies, as well as online news sites and trade organizations. Published 
literature is under the ownership of the corporate library, and unpublished work is under the umbrella 
of the corporate technology evaluation and planning (CTEP) group that manages the ELS. Currently, 
the team accesses more than 900 diﬀ erent sources of information as a part of its scouting activities. 

When a technology scout ﬁ nds a relevant piece of information, he or she creates an alert in the ELS 
that contains a synopsis of the information, the source of the information, and a link to the complete 
source. He or she then searches the ELS proﬁ les to identify people interested in the topic and may 
select appropriate distribution lists to which users subscribe. After she identiﬁ es the interested parties, 
she sends an e-mail through the ELS with a summary of the alert and a link to the full information. 
Technology scouts are careful to obey copyright laws and store only synopses of articles rather than 
extensive coverage. 

Searching Air Product and Chemicals’ ELS for an expert or alert is similar to searching the Internet. 
Th  e searcher enters one or more search terms with optional Boolean commands. Search results may 
contain names of experts and proﬁ le excerpts or short pieces of an alert. Clicking on the appropriate 
search result will link the user to either the proﬁ le screen or the full alert. Links are available from the 
proﬁ les to the corporate directory.

Because the ELS was created as a support function for the technology scouting process, a business 
case was not required to obtain initial funding. In addition, the low-cost, skunkworks foundation drew 

92

Expertise Locator Systems: Finding the Answers  •  ©2003 APQC

A I R   P R O D U C T S

little ﬁ nancial management attention because it required minimal funding to start and maintain (a few 
hundred dollars annually). As the project grew and moved to the current Web-based model, funding 
requirements grew but were still relatively small ($20,000 investment and 0.35 FTEs to maintain and 
upgrade the ELS). Budget negotiations were painless given the inherent value of the system in the 
research and development function. 

Th  e use of anecdotes, feedback on individual technology alerts, and testimonials from users generate 
support for ELS at the executive level. Th  e chief technology oﬃ  cer is a user of the system and receives 
alerts. As a result, he has ﬁ rst-hand experience with ELS and is able to champion its value to his peers 
and direct reports.

DESIGN AND FEATURES

Th  e most important design feature of the ELS is that it was based on existing processes and only 
served to enhance the eﬀ ectiveness and eﬃ  ciency of those processes rather than adding new processes 
to the organization or create additional complexity. Th  e company’s corporate culture may question 
the introduction of new processes, including those caused by the implementation of SAP and the 
process changes that accompany it, because they are perceived as adding new work to a heavy workload. 
Th  erefore, ELS was distinctly positioned as a user-driven enhancement to an existing manual process, 
not as a new initiative or process.

Th  e technology scouting organization, which reports through a corporate technology function, 
adapted the existing processes to the Web-based interface. An in-house information technology team, 
which is part of the research and development management information systems group, designed the 
new system. Th  e key system requirements were:
• 
•  Web-based technologies;
• 
• 
•  user-initiated updates and queries.

the ability to integrate with the corporate e-mail system and network security architecture;
the capability to combine employee proﬁ les with alert storage and processing; and

an open system, available globally;

Although the designers initially focused on providing the system primarily for a single global function 
(research and development), they ensured that the system was designed and built with scalability up to 
the enterprise level.

Before developing its ELS, Air Products and Chemicals conducted an external benchmarking study 
and found that technology scouting at other large industrial companies relied heavily on personal 
networks and did not involve formal information technology systems. Th  e ﬁ nding supported the decision 
to build its own system and increase its competitive advantage by incorporating the organization’s unique 
capability into a custom system. 

Th  e company avoids many privacy issues by making participation in the ELS voluntary. Employees 
supply proﬁ le information and may change it at any time. Th  rough a corporate directory, the ELS 
provides basic, non-conﬁ dential information including e-mail addresses, group names, and oﬃ  ce phone 
numbers. Private information such as HR-related data is not accessible through the ELS and is closely 
guarded by Air Products and Chemicals. When employees leave the company, administrators remove 
or archive their proﬁ les. An automated script that compares employees in the corporate database to the

A I R   P R O D U C T S

proﬁ les within the system runs every week. Th  e administrator routes exceptions to a member of the ELS 
team, who investigates and adjusts the proﬁ les appropriately. 

Policies integral to the ELS include copyright and intellectual property protection. With respect 
to copyrights, alerts include links to news rather than the full text in order to respect the copyrights of 
the authors and publishers. Safeguards and checks are built into the system to ensure that the company 
complies with the law. Intellectual property protection is an important internal policy concern. Air 
Products and Chemicals’ legal department mandates that expert proﬁ les not provide too many details 
regarding ideas that may be patented or tagged as trade secrets. If this is the case and details are widely 
disseminated, then Air Products and Chemicals jeopardizes its ability to secure legal protection. Hidden 
ﬁ elds are available within the system to maintain relevant information but to prevent it from being widely 
disseminated and thus risking loss of intellectual property protection.

Information management is largely a manual process within the ELS. Employees key in their own 
proﬁ les, although in some instances, technology scouts may interview employees and create proﬁ les for 
them. Employees are responsible for the accuracy of their proﬁ les and are motivated to be accurate so 
that they receive the appropriate alerts. If a proﬁ le is out of date, employees may receive information 
they no longer value. If an employee is working on a new topic, he or she may not receive information 
critical to his development process and thus be at a disadvantage. Th  e ELS team does not validate, nor 
does it require managers to validate, any of the information on the expert proﬁ les.

Th  e technology scouts also update proﬁ les with information gleaned from monitoring literature 
searches, research reports, corporate and departmental newsletters and research summaries, idea 
submissions, seminars, and other existing internal sources. Th  ese sources are also used to identify 
potential new experts within the organization to interview and solicit participation from.

In general, experts designate themselves in the ELS. Th  e terminology the company uses is described 

in 

Figure 1. For example, a director-level team identiﬁ ed experts in “safety” because safety is critical due 
to the nature of the company’s business. Th  ese individuals have demonstrated expertise and knowledge 
and are speciﬁ cally singled out as experts in the area.

IMPLEMENTATION AND LAUNCH

A I R   P R O D U C T S

Implementation of the ELS happened gradually over a period of 15 years. In its early days, 
implementation was a grassroots eﬀ ort that grew organically based on word-of-mouth and personal 
recruiting. With the advent of the company intranet, the ELS was migrated to a database with a Web-
based interface to greatly improve the dissemination of alerts and to open up access to this valuable 
resource to others in the company. At this point, a large user base already existed, and the primary 
product (technology alerts) had recognized value. No new processes were created. Instead, the Web-
based application merely built increased capability in existing processes. Consequently, the existing user 
base moved to a more formal system without too much pain. When the KM group adopted the ELS 
in 2002, the ELS opened up new opportunities because of the increased enterprise-wide exposure and 
credibility it lent. 

Participation in the ELS is rewarded intrinsically rather than with prizes or awards. Th  e team 
determined that the “carrot” of technology alerts was much more powerful than a “stick.” To receive 
focused technology alerts, an employee must have a detailed and accurate proﬁ le. Automatic e-mail 
messages are sent on a semiannual basis to remind employees to update their proﬁ les. If employees have 
updated their proﬁ les within the last six months, then they do not receive a reminder e-mail. 

Statistics show a 200 percent increase in use as people update their proﬁ les following the reminder. 
Th  is rewards system is supported by the talking points that technology scouts use when promoting 
the tool to groups and in one-on-one interviews. Scouts focus on the beneﬁ ts that employees can reap 
through technology alerts and indicate that the only way to receive these beneﬁ ts is by having a proﬁ le. If 
scouts emphasized having a proﬁ le over having the alerts, then the response might not be as favorable.

Th  e company has not deployed a formal marketing plan but intends to do so with the upcoming 
release of the latest upgrade. Because of the historic organic growth and the scope limited to the research 
and development group, the team did not see a marketing plan as critical to the development and success 
of the system. Also, HR has considered deploying SAP’s skill mapping module and has asked the KM 
organization not to undertake a large-scale marketing plan as part of an enterprise rollout to avoid 
possible confusion between the initiatives. To prepare for the enterprise-wide deployment, the team has 
published a series of articles in the corporate newsletter to build awareness and support.

TECHNOLOGY AND MAINTENANCE

Th  e current ELS model is built with standard Web technologies including active server pages, 
Microsoft search capabilities, a Windows 2000 Server, and a SQL Server 2000 database. Th  e upgrade, 
released in fall 2003, is written in Microsoft’s Net framework, which provides a richer user interface and 
will greatly enhance the overall user experience. Process support is provided by the CTEP, and IT support 
is provided by the technical data systems team. 

Integration of the system is occurring with several corporate functions, including the corporate 
directory, active directory network security, and Microsoft Exchange (e-mail). No signiﬁ cant integration 
issues have arisen; however, speciﬁ c systems are not to be integrated with the ELS because of security 
concerns. For example, the company has a policy that HR systems are closed and cannot be linked to any 
other system. Th  e company stores research reports on a separate database and does not integrate them 
with the ELS because of their conﬁ dential information. Technology scouts review the research reports 
and may update or create proﬁ les based on authorship of a report. 

Expertise Locator Systems: Finding the Answers  •  ©2003 APQC

95

A I R   P R O D U C T S

Th  e ELS has been upgraded on an annual basis since its major transformation to the Web-based 
model. Despite these annual upgrades, it is still more cost eﬀ ective to use the built model rather than 
convert to an oﬀ -the-shelf solution. Factors in this decision include avoiding cost for upgrades and seat 
licenses and having the ﬂ exibility to add features ad hoc. As upgrades have taken place, maintaining the 
consistency of the end user experience, increasing the ﬂ exibility of the system, and improving internal 
metrics have been the primary focus. Th  e team built into the latest upgrade the dynamic building of 
proﬁ les so that the team can readily add ﬁ elds without modifying the program code. As an example, 
adding languages provides signiﬁ cant beneﬁ t to the system and to users and can be readily added to the 
proﬁ les at no additional expense and with minimal eﬀ ort.

Accountability for the ELS is held by the CTEP group, the manager of which reports to the chief 
technology oﬃ  cer. Technical data systems is responsible for the IT aspects of the system. IT funding 
comes from an executive committee and is justiﬁ ed during the budget cycle. To support the system, 
CTEP allocated approximately 1.2 FTEs as technology scouts, 1.2 FTE for clerical support, and 0.1 FTE 
for ELS administration. IT support and upgrades require only 0.25 FTE from the IT organization. 

MEASURES AND RESULTS

Th  e team uses a variety of measures to analyze and gauge the success of the ELS. Success is not 
measured for the tool, but for the process it seeks to automate (i.e., technology alerting). In other 
words, users are asked to provide feedback not only on the system or its interfaces, but also principally 
on the content of the alerts and the degree to which they meet users’ needs. Besides the measures of 
alert content, “unique application users per month” (and per quarter) and the number of proﬁ les in the 
system and in targeted segments (such as research and development, as well as marketing) are measured. 
Th  e team tracks the currency of proﬁ les and the number of technology alerts pushed to users. Feedback 
forms are an important loop in the ELS system, and qualitative and quantitative feedback mechanisms 
are tracked.

Air Products and Chemicals uses measures and other tools to identify and understand areas for 
improvement within the system. Speciﬁ cally, metrics indicated that a signiﬁ cant percentage of the proﬁ les 
were outdated. To remedy this, the team created the semiannual e-mail reminder system and has seen 
marked improvement in the currency of proﬁ les. 

For the ﬁ rst time, the team surveyed its customers regarding the technology alerts, and the results 
were insightful. Th  e survey consisted of approximately 12 questions and addressed users’ perceptions of 
the technology alerts. Th  e ELS team hopes to continue to survey regularly. Sample areas of investigation 
included user perceptions of the following topics:
•  how users decided which alerts to read,
• 
• 
• 

the percentage of alerts containing new information for the reader,
the percentage of alerts useful for reference only,
the percentage of alerts suﬃ  ciently relevant that users forwarded or discussed them with someone 
else,
the degree to which alerts contributed to decision making or action by the reader,
the percentage of alerts that users plan to take action on, and
the actions taken by readers as a result of alerts.

• 
•

Expertise Locator Systems: Finding the Answers  •  ©2003 APQC

A I R   P R O D U C T S

Survey results indicated that nearly 70 percent of users said that alerts caused them to talk with 
someone else or show the information to someone else. Eighteen percent of users reported that at least 
50 percent of the alerts they received prompted conversations with others. Th  e actions taken by readers 
as a result of alerts included addressing competitive threats (30 percent), calling inventors (10 percent), 
and initiating the technology transfer process (a small number of responses). 

Th  e team recognized three primary opportunities for improvement in the survey results. First, survey 
results indicated that individuals receiving alerts were generally satisﬁ ed with them; however, better 
targeting was a concern for many, and some people wanted more rather than fewer alerts. Th  e team is 
broadening the terms to identify interested users for speciﬁ c distribution lists by comparing proﬁ les to 
distribution lists and considering other actions to improve targeting. Secondly, the team is trying to ﬁ nd 
new ways of summarizing the information. Popular areas generate dozens of alerts per month, and users 
requested that the technology scouts prepare summaries of related alerts so that the users can better digest 
the information. Summarizing is a large task for the limited support staﬀ , and the team has yet to identify 
a method to address this request. Finally, users noted some preferences for giving feedback that diﬀ ered 
from the current methods. Th  e latest upgrade will include more unobtrusive feedback mechanisms 
targeted speciﬁ cally at the action users took based on the alert. 

LESSONS LEARNED

During the deployment of its ELS, Air Products and Chemicals has learned many lessons and seeks 
to leverage them as it continues to upgrade and gather feedback. Th  e team identiﬁ ed four critical success 
factors.
1.  Tie the ELS to an existing business process. In the company, new process initiatives are sometimes 
perceived negatively. By tying it into an existing process that is seen as valuable by employees, the 
team immediately generated a supportive following for the ELS.

2.  Give people a vested interest in posting and maintaining proﬁ les. Collaboration and the opportunity 
to receive new information on topics of interest is a motivator, and the price of admission is 
completing and updating a proﬁ le.

3.  Th  e ELS needs both bottom-up and top-down support to expand throughout the enterprise. Th  e 
organic growth of the system in its early years built a very strong foundation in a pivotal user group. 
However, in order to gain the credibility and acceptance of the enterprise, more executive support 
(the KM group) was needed.

4.  Keep the system low maintenance. Th  e more maintenance costs required for systems, the higher the 
likelihood it will be a target for budget cuts. Keeping the system simple and easy-to-use not only 
improves the user experience, but also allows it to “ﬂ y under the (budget-cutting) radar.”

In the larger upgrades, the team hit barriers or unexpected obstacles. Th  ree obstacles were a lack 
of ﬁ nancial ﬂ exibility, a lack of visibility to senior management, and a lack of processes to update and 
integrate information. Because members of upper management were not users or clients of the system 
and therefore not well versed in the beneﬁ ts it generated, some were hesitant to increase the funding for 
needed upgrades. Th  e team invited these leaders to create proﬁ les and receive alerts themselves. Once 
they were a part of the system, they better understood and supported requests for funding. As a corollary, 
because the system was operated as a skunkworks for so long on a shoestring budget, the increase in 
funding to move it to the Web-based system drew attention that the team had not anticipated.

Th  e ELS team did not foresee the HR-related issues. It did not plan for the number of proﬁ les 
that were out of date because of employees who had left the organization. To handle these proﬁ les, the 
team developed a weekly process for matching the proﬁ le database against the corporate database and 
identifying and addressing exceptions on the report. 

HR security barriers prevented the ELS from integrating with the HR database and thus providing 
potentially robust information to users. Access to critical HR systems is well guarded by the company, 
and pressure from recent legislation, including the Patriot Act, has only increased this security. As a result, 
the two systems will not be integrated in the near future, and the team must seek more creative ways to 
add depth to the proﬁ les in an eﬃ  cient manner.

Figure 2 details at a high level what worked particularly well in the ELS system and what that the 
team saw as areas for improvement. Th  e list will help the team focus on closing the gaps in the current 
system as they work toward the ideal state.

Figure 2:  High Level ELS Implementation Results

What Worked

What Did Not Work

•    The alerting system was a great incentive 

•    The team should have broadened the user base more

for employees to create proﬁ les.

systematically when the system was opened to the enterprise.

•    People’s preferences drove changes 
in the system, such as the addition of 
distribution lists for key alert topics.

•    Focusing on business results

(e.g., technology scouting results) was 
superior to building an ELS for its own sake.

•    The system is simple and low maintenance.

•    Although the system is global, it does not have 

local contacts to rpovide direct support.

•    The system does not have local language support.

Th  ree items cited as not having worked well to date are linked to the enterprise-wide expansion. 
To have been more successful with the enterprise launch, the ELS team should have developed and 
deployed a structured marketing and launch plan to systematically educate and bring users into the 
system. Instead, the initial inﬂ ux of users was uneven and caused a few bumps in the road. Th  e second 
and third points are related to the global limitations of the system. Although there are KM contacts 
globally, they have not been engaged to provide front-line support for the system and thus users outside 
the United States may experience time delays or cultural or language barriers when interacting with the 
system. Finally, whereas English is the primary language at Air Products and Chemicals, the lack of local 
language support may limit the applicability of some alerts to users not in English-speaking areas. To 
curb the potential language issues, ELS proﬁ les will now include a language competency ﬁ eld and some 
experts may be tapped to translate relevant materials into other languages for dissemination.

Honeywell

Honeywell is a diversiﬁ ed technology manufacturer of aerospace products and services; control 

technologies for buildings, homes, and industry; automotive products; power generation systems; 

specialty chemicals; ﬁ bers; plastics; and advanced materials. 

Th  e company employs approximately 100,000 people in 95 countries and operates hundreds of 

facilities throughout the world. 

Honeywell agreed to be acquired by General Electric in 2001, but EU regulators vetoed the deal on 
antitrust concerns. In the aftermath, former AlliedSignal CEO Lawrence A. Bossidy replaced Michael 
Bonsignore at Honeywell’s helm. When Bossidy retired in 2002, David Cote became CEO.

Facing the economic slowdown and the fallout from the aborted GE deal, Honeywell closed 50 
plants and set about driving productivity in the company through an aggressive digitization program 
it calls “DigitalWorks.” Today the company retains its emphasis on productivity but has increased its 
focus on growth. 

OVERVIEW OF ELS

Th  e development of the expert locator tool can be traced to a 2001 corporate strategic planning 
session in which the CEO singled out knowledge management as an area to be explored as a means to 
enable strategic growth. By focusing on solutions with the potential to impact Honeywell’s key business 
drivers (responsiveness, agility, eﬀ ectiveness, and productivity), senior leaders believed the organization 
could achieve its goal to grow by focusing on the customer. 

A team sponsored by the chief information oﬃ  cer identiﬁ ed two primary categories of KM to focus 
on at Honeywell: information depots and sharing networks. Information depots are the myriad of 
databases, Excel spreadsheets, and Web servers that exist at most large organizations. Th  ese house the 
information or data used by employees and can be categorized as “explicit data.” Th  e second category, 
sharing networks, involves tacit information and is the means by which individuals look for people or 
information.

Th  e team conducted a survey as a part of the preliminary research that demonstrated that company 
employees spend approximately 10 hours per week searching for information or people who have that 
information. As a result of this research and with the support of the CEO and CIO, the KM core group 
developed and deployed an expertise locator system designed to enable the sharing of expertise and best 
practices across departmental and geographic boundaries. Th  e system, called AskMe, is housed under 
the company’s collaboration umbrella. (KM is a subset of collaboration at Honeywell and is often not 
called out explicitly as its own discipline.)

Th  e company could manage the system in a centralized fashion with deployment based on the pull of 
users and user groups. Th  e term “expert” was not culturally acceptable because employees were reluctant 
to identify themselves as experts, but they were very willing to participate in the system as “knowledge 
providers.” One of the fundamental choices made by the design team was to identify users as knowledge 
providers rather than experts. 

Figure 3 contrasts the two terms.

•    Presented as a point of view
•    Adopted as the reader’s discretion
•    Does not require certiﬁ cation

•    “AN” answer is…

Th  e methodology used to deploy the ELS parallels Honeywell’s other projects by using a stage-
gate process. Th  e implementation team places special emphasis on the process and asserts that the 
organization is willing to stop projects at various gates if they are not successful. Th  e team worked to 
meet goals and objectives at each gate rather than count on executive-level support or initial funding to 
carry the project to launch. 

Th  e stage-gate process and resources characterizing each phase are detailed in 
Figure 4. Th  e entire project, from identiﬁ cation and exploration to phased deployment, required 26 
weeks and a budget of slightly more than $100,000. Th  e team employed an oﬀ -the-shelf solution and 
did very little customization. Th  e majority of the implementation cost was incurred by a culture study 
conducted by IDEO, an outside consultant. A core team was used to plan and launch the system.

Th  e basic process employed by users of AskMe is detailed in Figure 5. Beginning at the bottom left, 
an employee has a business problem and searches the database to see if he or she can leverage an existing 
entry. Answers come back as “previously asked questions,” FAQs, or best practices. If these responses are 
not enough, then he or she uses AskMe to pose a question either through the portal or an e-mail. Th  e 
question is distributed to potential knowledge providers identiﬁ ed within the network. A knowledge 
provider answers the question and creates a new solution, which is captured into the database and 
distributed to the knowledge-seeker and any other employees with similar interests who have subscribed 
to the distribution list.

As a pilot, the tool was deployed to two groups: Six Sigma and aerospace customer service. Pilot 
results indicated that the use of the system saved 40 hours per user annually by reducing the time to 
ﬁ nd answers. Th  e pilot sites encompass hundreds of global sites and have nearly 2,000 registered users 
or knowledge providers. Th  e results of the pilot were extrapolated to Honeywell’s approximately 30,000 
professionals that were potential users of AskMe. Approximately 12 other corporate organizations are 
currently in various stages of pulling the application into their groups. 

DESIGN AND FEATURES

Th  e team tasked with completing phases one and two (planning and pilot execution, and value 
identiﬁ cation) was designed to be inclusive and relied on project-critical groups to provide employees to 
support the project. Th  e core team was divided into two groups: culture, measures, and results. 

Figure 6 lists the core team members, as well as auxiliary members.

Two new key team roles—program whip (a vendor, recognized in a role similar to a senate majority 
leader whip) and executive program whip (Honeywell)–enabled the team to execute successfully. Th  e 
CIO and CEO were the named sponsors, and the project had whips at lower levels in the organization 
and the vendor (director-level) charged with removing implementation barriers and identifying solutions 
as necessary. Honeywell considers the whip roles a best practice in its organization. 

Th  e core team included a communication adviser to prevent “obsessive messaging.” Th  is individual 
was dedicated to the project and ensured that solid messages were consistently communicated throughout 
the life of the project. Company representatives believe that communication is an area in which it has 
room for improvement.

Vendor Selection

H O N E Y W E L L

Members of the vendor/technology selection team included the program lead, technical driver, and 
design and administration. Th  is team was charged with identifying potential vendors and managing the 
decision-making process through selection and implementation. Th  e ultimate decision makers served 
on this team.

Because Six Sigma is embedded in Honeywell’s culture, the management approach provided the 
toolset by which the technology selection decision was made. Th  e vendor/technology selection sub-
team identiﬁ ed speciﬁ c technical requirements, user-based requirements, and possible failure modes. 
Each requirement was weighted, and the team rated each of the potential vendors against all of them. 
Th  e team started with seven potential vendors and narrowed the pool to three vendors: AskMe, Tacit, 
and Sopheon (formerly Orbital). Th  e team distributed a request for quote and then narrowed the ﬁ eld 
to AskMe and Tacit. After careful analysis, the team chose AskMe because of the ﬁ t with Honeywell’s 
culture, the structure of the tool, and its overall score based on the requirements detailed in the matrix. 
One of the reasons the team eliminated Tacit was the vendor’s heavy reliance on e-mail proﬁ ling. 
AskMe’s primary reference is questions and answers, and Tacit relies on keywords embedded in outgoing 
e-mails. Although Honeywell employees recognize that the corporation owns the e-mail content, the 
culture study identiﬁ ed Tacit’s approach as a barrier to success because of a low acceptance by employees. 
As the team compared and contrasted the vendors, it noted that AskMe was further along in its way to 
rounding out its technology portfolio.

Th  e ELS team shared information with Intel to learn from its pilot and deployment eﬀ orts. (Intel also 
uses AskMe.) Th  e Honeywell team traveled from its Scottsdale, Ariz. location to Chandler, Ariz. to visit 
Intel and learn ﬁ rst-hand from its experience. After talking with the Intel team, Honeywell decided to 
limit its focus on technology assessment because of detailed analysis already conducted by Intel. Instead, 
the Honeywell team focused much of its planning eﬀ orts on analyzing its culture to identify critical 
success factors and potential barriers for success.

Policies and Privacy 

Th  e team was concerned with policies and privacy as it developed the tool. Participation in AskMe 
is entirely voluntary, which addresses European concerns regarding privacy and information sharing. 
Participants are instructed that they should not participate if they have any reservations concerning 
privacy. All foreign nationals are tagged in the system to allow their activity to be audited by the legal 
department if necessary. Security and access is managed via the corporate LDAP by using employee 
identiﬁ cation numbers. Any question can be marked “private” at any time, and marking an item as such 
takes it out of public view. 

Profiles and Expertise Identification

AskMe is structured so that knowledge providers complete and maintain their own profiles 
the ﬁ rst time they log in to the system. Users complete a Web-based form and proﬁ le white papers 
and Word documents in the system. (Th  e system has the capability to proﬁ le e-mail, but this is not 
currently enabled.) Maintaining up-to-the-minute proﬁ les was identiﬁ ed as a potential opportunity for 
failure during the planning phase, but during the course of the pilot and large-scale launch it has not 
emerged as an issue. One does not have to be a registered knowledge provider to use the system to seek 
information.

IMPLEMENTATION AND LAUNCH

Th  e approach for designing and implementing the ELS solution followed a design for Six Sigma 

methodology, as detailed in Figure 7. Design for Six Sigma relies on six steps:
1.  understand the customer needs,
2.  deﬁ ne initial solution,
3.  model the design performance,
4.  optimize the design for value,
5.  verify the design and models, and
6.  control the design quality.

Figure 7:  Stage-gate Process and Design for Six Sigma

One of the foundational elements of the project was the culture study. A group lead by corporate 
organizational development partnered with IDEO, an outside consultant. Th  is team employed a three-
pronged approach to gathering the voice of the customers (users). Th  e team observed seven users in 
Phoenix and Minneapolis and identiﬁ ed unarticulated needs that might be resolved through the ELS. 
Th  e team distributed a survey to the pilot community, and responses from 465 members were analyzed. 
Finally, the team interviewed previous application and solution owners to gather lessons learned. 
According to the AskMe program lead, the study drew 40 percent of its input from observation, 40 
percent from the survey, and 20 percent from the lessons learned exercise.

A ﬁ nding from the culture study included a baseline for an ROI estimate; speciﬁ cally, people spend 
approximately 10 hours per week searching for information or people who have the right knowledge. 
Other important ﬁ ndings follow.
•  Focus should be on connecting people, not just making information available.
•  Th  e success of the system depends on constant, visible executive and organizational support.
• 

Information providers should be rewarded, and the most eﬀ ective rewards are reciprocity, repute, 
and altruism.

•  Groups have diverse work styles and needs.
•  Th  e system should ﬁ t with the employee’s current work ﬂ ow and tools.
•  Some employees are concerned about the repercussions of sharing what they know.
•  Some employees have preconceived perceptions based on previous application rollouts.

Th  e team translated the ﬁ ndings into a nine-item, recommendation-based checklist and the assessed 

feasibility.
1.  Pre-populate the system to provide value at the time of launch.
2.  Enable pilot participants to provide feedback, and be willing to redesign the system to reﬂ ect their 

needs and desires.

3.  Drive the system with dedicated staﬀ .
4.  Search results should present people ﬁ rst.
5.  Do not impose rules. Do provide guidance for contacts that claim expertise in a subject.
6.  Be clear about the beneﬁ ts of using the system at each stage of the problem-solving process (gather, 

research, synthesize, solve, and publish).

7.  Th  e system should address employees’ concerns about privacy and publishing
information.
8.  Be clear in communication and training concerning what this system is used for and when other 

9.  Make it clear that the system is not a replacement for anything; it is a new functionality. Communicate 

tools are better.

the “big picture.”

Items 2 and 3 are driven by the company’s desire for ELS to be a low-cost solution. If the associated 
costs were minimal, then the team redesigned the system based on pilot participants’ feedback. Th  e team 
did not accept “driving the system with a dedicated staﬀ ,” but rather recruited volunteer proponents or 
advocates to drive its success.

AskMe connects people and makes information available. Th  e tool publishes people’s names both 
in response to questions and in answers to FAQs. Each proﬁ le can include a picture of the user in any 
environment. Some users have baby pictures and others have more formal studio portraits. Knowledge 
seekers’ and providers’ proﬁ les may include “non-private personal information.” When creating a proﬁ le, 
the user may elect to answer any or all of 14 questions ranging from “my favorite game is” to “one of the 
goals for my future is.” Figure 8 lists the questions posed by Honeywell. Th  is helps to break the ice and 
builds relationships rather than just providing information.

Communications was another critical element to the success of Honeywell’s system. Th  e team 
developed a full, detailed communication plan with dedicated resources to support it. Th  e culture 
study fed the communication plan, and messages were tailored to Honeywell’s unique needs and, more 
speciﬁ cally, the needs of the pilot groups (Six Sigma and customer service). Th  e top-level communication 
planks are detailed in Figure 9. 

Figure 9:  Honeywell Senior-level Communication Messages

1.  The company is not optimizing its potential if it fails to facilitate and encourage the company-wide sharing of 
information, knowledge, and expertise; opening cross-company lines of communications will make us more 
successful. 

2.  Knowledge networking is about creating employee-to-employee information sharing in order to drive productivity, 
improve customer service, create business opportunities, and enhance employee development. It is not document 
management.

3.  Technology (e.g., the Internet and e-mail) and AskMe create a powerful and easy way to share information 
throughout the company. There are great beneﬁ ts for the “seeker” and no signiﬁ cant incremental workload for the 
“knower.”

Th  e team used three methods of communicating to potential users within the pilot community: 
consistent e-mail communication, face-to-face communication by the executive sponsors and team 
members, and invitations to participate. Th  e invitations were hand-signed by the member of the core 
team who had a relationship with the potential user or user group. Th  e invitations were mailed so that 
the communication did not feel like “spamming” to the potential user. A follow-up reminder postcard 
was also delivered in hard copy to encourage participation.

Technology and Maintenance

H O N E Y W E L L

Honeywell deployed AskMe technology to enable its expertise locator system. AskMe was deployed 
using a single instance model and was a part of the organization’s central IT infrastructure. Honeywell’s 
IT group prefers the single instance model because it enables scalability, wide-scale deployment, and 
centralization. 

AskMe was deployed as an integrated tool and linked with Microsoft Outlook (e-mail), Honeywell’s 
portal tools, and IBM’s LDAP in use at Honeywell. Th  e system met all security requirements and ﬁ rewalls. 
In the near future, the team would like to integrate the project tracking database and instant messaging 
with AskMe. Other systems that are on the Honeywell considers integrating with ELS include:
•  CRM (Siebel Systems Inc.),
•  project management (eProject ™),
•  HR (PeopleSoft Inc.),
• 
•  LMS (Saba Software Inc.).

federated search (Google Inc.), and

When tasked with a “build versus buy” decision, Honeywell identiﬁ ed critical success factors and 
lessons learned from earlier IT-related deployments and determined that buying an oﬀ -the-shelf solution 
was the most appropriate for the organization and the intended use of the ELS. One key factor is the 
ability to leverage other customers’ experiences with a vendor, and using an external vendor enabled this 
in a way impossible for an internally built system. 

Figure 10 details advantages and disadvantages for the build versus buy decision at Honeywell.

Figure 10:  Honeywell Build Versus Buy Comparison

Buy
•    Cheaper (short term and long term)

•    Better support

Build

•    Almost always slower to deliver

•    Almost always costs more (true costs)

•    Fit for purpose (making collaboration products is not Honeywell’s

corebusiness)

•    Almost always does less

•    Beneﬁ t of other customer input (Intel Corp., Ford Motor Co., The 

Boeing Company, The Procter & Gamble Co., and others)

•    Almost always is out-of-date quicker

Honeywell launched the AskMe by pre-populating employee proﬁ les and without populating the 
content database. During the course of the Six Sigma and customer service pilot projects, the content 
rose. In addition, the team set and managed other metrics regarding the content to gauge the depth 
and breadth of the system. Because the system can integrate with existing databases, it could have been 
populated before the pilot study. 

Th  e system enables users to set data to automatically expire on speciﬁ ed dates when the information 
is submitted or at some point in its life cycle. In this case, data is not deleted from the system but hidden 
from the view of everyone but the owner.

Maintenance of AskMe is the responsibility of the IT group for infrastructure-related issues and 
of business units for expansion-related decisions. Honeywell estimated that the launch of the system 
required two or three FTEs from the core team. Figure 11 details the FTE requirements to support the 
system on an ongoing basis. Th  is is not the investment required to launch the system or to deploy it to 
new areas.

Measures and results are important in Honeywell’s culture and played a key role in the stage-gate 
process employed by the ELS team. One of two sub-teams focused on measures and results. Th  e team 
used the Six Sigma DMAIC process and tools to identify and select its measures. Th  e team adjusted and 
ﬁ ne-tuned communications and strategies based on emerging measurement patterns. 

Th  e team identiﬁ ed 10 metrics of success and seven usage metrics that could be used to manage the 
project. Although many other metrics were and are tracked, 10 were identiﬁ ed as the “critical few.” Usage 
metrics served as leading indicators of performance and were updated on a more frequent basis (daily or 
multiple times per day) as compared to the metrics of success. 

In order to identify the 17 metrics noted above, the team asked the AskMe vendor to provide every 
metric that any customer had ever used related to the tool. Th  e vendor identiﬁ ed 57 unique metrics, and 
the team created a quality, function, deploy (QFD) matrix to measure and track meeting of customer 
requirements. Th  e 10 metrics of success and their targets are detailed in Figure 12. Th  e team records 
these measures and usage metrics on a weekly scorecard for communication and dissemination to key 
stakeholders.

Honeywell’s ROI exceeded the initial goal of 12 percent and can be estimated using both hard or 
soft costs elimination and avoidance. AskMe’s ROI was created purely of soft money; in other words, 
no people were eliminated as a byproduct of the system’s success. Th  e savings was calculated from 
the baseline of 10 hours per week that employees use to search for information or people who have 
the knowledge they seek. Pilot results indicated that users could save 40 hours per year searching for 
information and people. Th  e team calculated the ROI by multiplying by the number of users and the 
average cost per user. Hard numbers were captured in the system through feedback mechanisms, but 
these numbers were harder to validate and attribute correctly. Th  ey were valuable as anecdotal support 
for the system.

LESSONS LEARNED

Honeywell identiﬁ ed high-impact lessons learned.

1.  Have a charter. Honeywell advises that teams take time to create a charter but the team should not 
worry about wasting time by writing a “perfect” charter. Manage time and eﬀ ort wisely so that the 
charter is solid and provides direction but is ﬂ exible as the project evolves.

2.  Set program boundaries. By scoping the project and clearly communicating the boundaries, the core 

team ensured that everyone was on the same page and moving along the same path.

3.  Use stage gates. Having stage gates was a cultural norm, and the team’s success depended on 
employing this methodology and navigating it well. Honeywell advises that a key success factor is 
having the right people controlling the gate with the understanding that if the project did not meet 
its requirements, it would not proceed.

4.  Choose your team and initial deployment groups wisely.
5.  Critical success factors included executive ownership, inclusion of similar projects and activities, and 

ﬁ nding zealots to support the system.

6.  Select a pilot group that is eager to “pull the technology” instead of one for which the solution is a 

“push.” Honeywell identiﬁ ed the following characteristics as important to its pilot participants:
•  driven; 
•  knowledgeable; 
• 
• 
• 
• 

 
 
 
 
 
 
7.  Pick the right metrics, clearly deﬁ ne success, and measure the right things at the right time.

cross-company, cross-area, and cross-functional; 
right mindset;

all focused on delivering productivity numbers.

8.  Culture and communication are everything. Nothing else matters if the culture is not receptive. 
Honeywell advocates having a plan and communicating something every 10 to 14 days as the 
program pilots and launches. Th  e communication plan should be detailed and well supported.

9.  Process change. Process change takes time because it requires convincing people to change their 

habits. Th  e team used training to teach people to do things the “new” way. 

10. Obstacles to process change are detailed in the list below. Each was uncovered in the process or

•  Users “forget” to use it.
• 
•  Understand organization and user security concerns and requirements

• 

“I’m not going to invest my time if this is just a pilot.”
 “Why isn’t it integrated with xyz?” Potential users wanted integration with other applications, 
even during the pilot.

and communications systems. Intel’s mission is to be the preeminent building block supplier to the 
Internet economy.

Intel is a leader in semiconductor manufacturing and technology and has established a competitive 
advantage through its scale of operations, agility of its factory network, and consistent execution 
worldwide. Intel has 11 fabrication facilities and six assembly and test facilities worldwide. In 2002 
Intel had a net revenue of $26.76 billion and net income of $3.1 billion. In the same year, Intel spent 
$4.7 billion on capital investments to help build manufacturing capacity and increase manufacturing 
eﬃ  ciency. Additionally, Intel spent $4 billion on R&D in 2002.

The company’s technology investments differentiate Intel from competitors and provide the 
foundation for future growth. Intel Labs, the R&D arm of Intel, is comprised of more than 6,000 
researchers and scientists in laboratories around the world.

OVERVIEW OF ELS

“Value is in the knowledge ﬂ ow, not in the knowledge store,” noted E. Sandvik and B. Lie-Nielsen, 
leaders of the Norwegian Consortium of Intellectual Capital. In designing and launching its ELS 
program, Intel used this axiom as its focal point to ensure that the solution it developed was applicable 
to the knowledge ﬂ ow required by users across the organization.

Th  e mission of KM at Intel is to increase the rate of learning and innovation through connecting 

knowledge workers and enabling the capture and reuse of their actionable knowledge. 

Figure 13 (page 112) illustrates the pyramid of capabilities that the KM team details to achieve this 
mission. If successful, KM will provide connectivity anywhere, collaboration anytime, and culturally 
acceptable information to anyone. Th  e foundation of the pyramid forms the base and must be solid in 
order to support the higher-level activities above it. As one moves up the pyramid, the capabilities and 
solutions become more complex and require stronger understanding and integration.

Th  e IT function sponsors KM, which leverages cross-functional teams through a grasroots approach. 
Th  e Intel culture supports this approach, and a recent IDC study showed that 52 percent of its members’ 
KM initiatives are driven by this approach. 

Figure 14 depicts the high-level KM leverage model. By using KM tools and technology to integrate 
business practices to an interactive people network (tacit knowledge) and a distributed knowledge 
repository (explicit knowledge), the organization is able to make better decisions.

Strategic initiatives in the KM function are divided into people, process, and technology categories. 
After conducting an internal assessment of business needs from the users’ perspectives, Intel identiﬁ ed the 
need for an ELS to serve the people category and prioritized it as the most-needed capability. Speciﬁ cally, 
an internal survey conducted throughout Intel showed a high demand for the ELS and a low level of 
competition or competing initiatives for the project. Th  e business drivers for ELS articulated by potential 
users included:
•  globally dispersed information, knowledge, and expertise;
• 
• 

shrinking time-to-results requirements; and
employee productivity demands.

In short, as the demand on Intel to compete in the global marketplace grew, so did the need to 
collaborate and connect across the organization to eﬃ  ciently leverage existing resources. Shrinking time-
to-results requires that employees not only locate the data and information rapidly, but also translate 
them into knowledge and wisdom to make better decisions across all boundaries including geography 
and culture.

Decisions

To develop the ELS, the KM team identiﬁ ed six distinct value propositions or business cases for 
deployment of a system across Intel. Th  e team identiﬁ ed the need for multiple business cases because 
of its certainty that there were a signiﬁ cant number of cultures within the overall Intel culture. To be 
successful, the team believed it needed to present the ELS concept and capabilities diﬀ erently to various 
groups to gain their buy-in and support as well as to ultimately meet users’ needs.

Th  e KM team presented these business cases, as well as pilot opportunities, to a select group of 
business managers for resources (human and ﬁ nancial) as well as pilot opportunities. Th  e business cases 
are detailed in Figure 15 (page 114) and work to describe diﬀ erent aspects or functionality within the 
ELS that can be leveraged by groups or individuals to meet their cultural and business-deﬁ ned needs. Th  e 
target audience for deployment is detailed in the second column. For example, the “people yellow pages” 
business case is designed for enterprise-wide or group-wide deployment. Its primary value proposition 
is to connect knowledge seekers with self-identiﬁ ed experts. In contrast, the value proposition for best-
known method is diﬀ erent because it relies on expert valuation of ideas and solutions for publication as 
best practices. 

 Whereas Intel detailed a number of diﬀ erent value propositions, the overall purpose and design of 
the ELS is static at the highest level. Th  e system serves to link employees with business problems to the 
ELS database via e-mail, intranet, shared servers, or instant messenger. Once connected to the system, the 
user can perform a natural language search for existing people or solutions. If the search does not provide 
the sought-after information, then the user can query the system (an expert or a group of experts). Once

Th  ree key enablers for the ELS are rewards and recognition, usage/value analysis, and training and 
learning. Each of these enablers is supported on an ongoing basis and reviewed for eﬀ ectiveness and 
eﬃ  ciency. Intel notes speciﬁ cally that the quality of transactions is critical to the success of a KM system 
and thus the usage/value analysis provides depth to the system. In other words, it is equally important 
to track the number of questions answered as it is to track the quality ratings of content in speciﬁ c areas.

Intel describes deployment of its ELS as a “teach to ﬁ sh” model and, as a result, carefully emphasizes the 
need for ongoing training and learning. Training must reﬂ ect the needs of the business and the quality 
of the solution set to be successful.

Intel’s deployment methodology is the project life cycle process (PLC process). Th  e process has six 
distinct phases (Figure 16). Funding was secured for the system during the exploration and planning 
phase. During the development phase, the team recognized and clearly articulated the need to focus 
on the inherent behaviors and cultures embedded within the organization. Th  e ﬁ nal product (AskMe) 
was selected during this phase. Using the foundation laid out in the development phase, the pilot phase 
engaged 1,200 users and populated the knowledge base. An important deliverable of the pilot phase was 
the workbook, which contained more than 500 pages of documentation to support the decisions made 
throughout the phases to date, lessons learned, and collateral for future decisions.

Following the pilot phase, the team entered the production phase, secured funding for an enterprise-
wide deployment, and developed and deployed the taxonomy to support the content. It developed 
change management processes during this phase and played a critical part in managing the complexity 
of the overall system. Th  e ramp and sustaining phases built upon the foundation outlined in the earlier 
phases and increased the user base and the quality and value of the tool and available content.

DESIGN AND FEATURES

The Intel ELS team received approval from four business managers with cross-functional 
responsibilities to launch the pilot project. Th  ese business managers approved funding of approximately 
$500,000, which came largely from the IT budget, and were willing to allocate human resources to 
support the planning and launch of the pilot and oﬀ er their own associates to serve as constituents for 
the pilot project. 

Th  e project team, consisting of seven people, dedicated on an average of 30 percent of their work 
time to developing and launching the ELS. Team members represented cross-functional units and had 
diverse backgrounds. Two team members had previous ELS experience; one with another company and 
one with an earlier, unsuccessful ELS eﬀ ort at Intel. Th  e team was divided into three teams: the core 
team, the business team, and the technology team. And each had speciﬁ c responsibilities and deliverables. 
Th  e eﬀ orts of each subteam were carefully orchestrated to manage the critical paths of the overall project. 
Team members detailed the touch point and operational ﬂ ow and communicated across all teams. 
When the team was convened, Intel had already made the decision to roll out the ELS throughout the 
enterprise, but the team focused on the group and/or community level for the pilot phase.

Th  e business team completed the functional requirements and process documentation. Speciﬁ cally, 
it detailed usage scenarios including the “as is” and “to be” usage maps and identiﬁ ed potential gaps to 
be ﬁ lled by the ELS. Th  e functional requirements were detailed and covered a wide variety of topics 
from ease of access to scalability and reliability requirements to spell check and reporting capabilities. 
In addition, the team developed marketing and training collateral to support the various roles within 
the ELS. 

Th  e ELS follows all the security and privacy rules mandated by Intel. Because participation is 
voluntary, Intel has not encountered any issues or constraints. Th  e system uses many of the security 
features built into the AskMe product including encryption and privacy locks. Th  e support team and/or 
moderator audits the content periodically to ensure that security rules are obeyed and that content is 
appropriately protected. When the audit uncovers potential issues or violations, the support team or 
moderator contacts the user directly and ask him or her to resolve the problem. In all cases, the user 
has resolved the problem quickly and without issue. In a severe instance, the security team would be 
contacted to resolve the issue.

Th  e business team clearly deﬁ ned roles and responsibilities, and Figure 17 lists them as outlined 
by the team. Th  e team deﬁ ned the roles and responsibilities carefully because it knew they would be 
applicable enterprise wide. Moderators dedicate approximately 20 percent of their time to the ELS. 

Identiﬁ cation of knowledge providers can occur in one of four ways:

1.  employees designate themselves as experts in ELS proﬁ les,
2.  self-assigned experts in a knowledge category,
3.  employees are assigned or nominated by a community in a knowledge category, or
4.  employees are assigned by the organization in a knowledge category.

Th  e means by which an expert is identiﬁ ed often reﬂ ects the degree of complexity of the knowledge to 
be shared. As one moves down the list above, the number of experts decreases signiﬁ cantly. Organization-
assigned experts are the most stringently evaluated and may own their process or have functional 
responsibility. Th  e designation may also be based on competency evaluation or subject matter expertise 
that results from years of service, industry recognition, or academic credentials.

Technology Team

Th  e technology team selected a vendor and ensured that the product met the business requirements 
and standards outlined by Intel in its oﬃ  ce system architecture. Th  e team quickly made the decision to 
buy the technology rather than to build it because of the resource requirements to build and support the 
degree of ﬂ exibility the Intel system would require. 

After identifying all the potential vendors in the market place (12), the team scored each against 
its perceived ability to meet the business requirements identiﬁ ed by the business team. Th  is process 
narrowed the ﬁ eld to four ﬁ nal candidates: AskMe, Tacit Knowledge Mill, Orbital, and Tikal. Each of 
the ﬁ nal candidates was provided the list of business requirements and invited to present its case to the 
team. After careful analysis, the team selected AskMe as the vendor. 

A critical piece of the development process was building the knowledge content through the 
taxonomy backbone and knowledge category systems. Th  e taxonomy backbone was based on the 
taxonomy employed by the Intel library. Th  is backbone was tested in interviews with 30 experts across 
16 divisions. Th  e team solidiﬁ ed the backbone, and the knowledge category development process began.

Countless knowledge categories exist under the backbone. Th  e moderator develops speciﬁ c categories 
during and following the training sessions. Th  e moderator is responsible for category maintenance and 
can change subcategory words up to (but not including) the highest level backbone. Th  e highest level 
can only be changed with the approval of an oversight committee.

One area that can have a signiﬁ cant impact on the eﬀ ectiveness and eﬃ  ciency of the system is 
the succinctness knowledge seekers should employ when posing questions. Intel’s culture is polite, 
and employees often pose questions with a greeting and salutation (“Hello, I’m John Doe”), insert 
unnecessary words in the question (“I am working on a project to”), and close with signatures (“Th  anks, 
John Doe”). When the additional words are added to the system, search time increases and errors are 
more frequent. For example, in the parenthetical references above, John Doe’s name would be returned 
as a potential expert on a question in the same area because his name is embedded in the text string from 
the dialogue.

IMPLEMENTATION AND LAUNCH

Th  e team piloted the ELS to understand its cultural and behavioral impacts before launching 
the system throughout the enterprise. As a part of the pilot, value and behavior baseline surveys were 
deployed before and after the launch. Th  e surveys provided the team with insight about how speciﬁ c 
job codes would react to knowledge sharing and the value that the ELS might bring. Survey results 
showed dramatic diﬀ erences in the behavior of engineers compared to that of marketing personnel. 
Consequently, the team built ﬂ exibility into the system so that it could be modiﬁ ed and adapted to 
make each group feel comfortable and demonstrate the value of sharing knowledge. Th  e team kicked oﬀ  
marketing campaigns, as well as rewards and recognition programs, in conjunction with the launch of 
the pilot. Th  e team gauged the success of the campaigns and programs over the course of the eﬀ ort.

Intel successfully completed the pilot phase in 10 months. Th  e team evaluated the success of the 
project by measuring it against the requirements (schedule, budget, usage, performance indicators, and 
ROI), as well as customers’ feedback. Th  e team saw a 13-week upward rolling trend for the number of 
logins and the number of knowledge exchanges. Th  e total pilot indicator measurement set is detailed 
in Figure 19. Th  e vendor provided benchmarking data. Had these requirements not been met, the pilot 
may not have been judged a success and the project could have been halted.

I N T E L

Th  e one measure of concern for Intel following the pilot was “total number of questions per month.” 
Speciﬁ cally, the industry average for “questions per month” was two per user per month. Intel’s average 
was 1.38. Th  e team is conducting additional analysis to better understand the trend and to try to reverse 
it if possible. 

In contrast, the number of knowledge providers is high as noted by the answer rate (93 percent for 
Intel as compared to the industry benchmark of 80 percent) and response time (91 percent answered 
within three days at Intel compared to 80 percent for the industry benchmark). In fact, some knowledge 
providers even complain that they are at a disadvantage, being non-U.S. based, because of the time delay 
for them to provide an answer. Th  ey say they are being “beaten out” and are disappointed not to be the 
ﬁ rst to provide a solution to the knowledge seeker. 

Intel is proud of its metric on the number of calls to the help desk it created to assist users. It set a 
target of 50 calls per month and has received only 25 calls over the life of the pilot. Th  is indicates that 
Intel deployed a strong training program and selected a tool that was easy to use and intuitive to most 
users. Th  e total cost of ownership should decrease because of cost avoidance to support the system 
through the help desk.

Production Setup

Following the pilot phase, the team moved into production. Intel approved the enterprise license 
based on a ROI to recoup all costs in three years. Intel has a goal of 20,000 users (or half the estimated 
base) within three years. Th  e ROI calculation was made by assuming to save 10 hours per year per user 
multiplied by an average run rate of $25 per hour. Th  e ﬁ nance team conducted a more sophisticated 
analysis and completed computation to move the ROI through the approval phase by taking into account 
tax rates for savings and other details.

Th  e headcount to support the system during production is fewer than three people. Th  ese individuals 
are tasked with product management, implementation, marketing, and value calculation. Intel uses the 
“teach to ﬁ sh” model and has many more resources in the ﬁ eld that dedicate time to maintaining and 
managing the product (moderators, experts, and champions).

Th  e ELS marketing strategy is depicted in Figure 20. Marketing will be customized for groups 
depending on their culture and business needs. Ideally, the rollout is coordinated and integrated with 
existing business tools so that it is as seamless to the end user as possible. Th  e areas that have caused 
the most diﬃ  culty are in the top-right quadrant of the diagram: functional areas with enterprise and 
customized solutions. Because these constituencies are so broad and divided by multiple functional silos, 
obstacles have proven diﬃ  cult to overcome.

Marketing and training programs are based on an infection model, which relies on word-of-mouth, 
door-to-door sales, company-side “ads,” and aggressive marketing techniques. Th  ree key success factors 
include (1) the reward program; (2) senior management role modeling; and (3) internal communication 
through road shows, newsletters, and seminars. Th  e team oﬀ ers training in a variety of formats including 
certiﬁ cation, online courses, and “train-the-trainer” models.

The rewards program has four levels and is designed to encourage participation through 

recognition.

Launch

Th  e ELS set-up and launch is customized based on the user’s or user group’s articulated business 
needs and culture. Th  e support team allows a signiﬁ cant amount of time to understand these factors and 
to apply the appropriate customized ELS solution set. Th  e following approach is used for deployment 
and collateral because it enables a repeatable process that speeds up the ELS implementation for groups 
with similar goals and processes. 

Figure 22 details this approach and the timeline associated with each step of the process. As the user 

base grows, the cycle time for launch will decrease based on the foundation built by earlier groups. 

Currently, the user base is 3,500 with an additional 2,000 in implementation. Additional users are 
being brought into the system as a result of peer inﬂ uence, self-motivation, awareness of the system, and 
the push of business drivers (e.g., speed to results, and productivity demands).

TECHNOLOGY AND MAINTENANCE

I N T E L

Because of the buy decision and the design of the product, the vendor product requires that Intel 
allocate only 0.5 FTE for infrastructure and 0.5 FTE for product engineering to support the backup 
and integrity of data. Another signiﬁ cant beneﬁ t, in Intel’s opinion, to the vendor product is that it is 
Web-based and, therefore, does not require client install or upgrade pushes, which may become costly 
and time consuming, to individual desktops.

As the system matures, Intel adds additional capabilities. In the near term, Intel would like to add a 
skill management capability and the Yellow Pages feature. Automating the retention process (including 
reminders for users to update their proﬁ les or to remove content) is also an important capability to 
be added. Finally, product integration is considered critical to success and is on the agenda for near-
term improvement, if possible. Th  e ELS team would like the system to integrate with company-wide 
applications, such as e-mail, scheduling tools, shared drivers, and instant messaging.

Maintaining the ELS from a non-technology standpoint requires 1.5 FTEs to address product, 
implementation consultation, and marketing and training collateral development and execution. 
Th  e maintenance model is owned primarily by IT. It controls the infrastructure, the ELS road map, 
and budget, as well as new capability design, implementation, and expansion with business groups’ 
support. 

Th  e audit and retention process is critical as the system matures and will gain more attention and 
focus over time. Currently, moderators and the support team conduct audits. E-mail is sent to remind 
users to update proﬁ les. Th  e reminders continue on a weekly basis until the proﬁ le is updated or deleted. 
Users have the opportunity to report obsolete or inappropriate content to their moderator or to the 
system administrator.

MEASURES AND RESULTS

Measuring the results of the ELS pilot and enterprise-wide deployment is critical to Intel’s success. 
Th  e highest-level goal for the ELS is to ramp up to 20,000 users by the end of 2004 (three years from 
start). As of August 2003, the system hosted 3,200 users, and Intel is on-target to hit its next major 
milestone of 5,000 users by the end of 2003. To track its progress, the team reviews both conservative 
and aggressive models. Intel notes that heavy marketing and communication eﬀ orts are needed because 
qualitative studies indicate that less than half of the potential user population has heard of the tool. 

Th  e quality of the tool is viewed equally to, if not more importantly then, the number of users. Intel 
captures success stories and anecdotes online through feedback mechanisms or the champions. It gives 
quarterly and annual awards to individuals that demonstrate high-quality use of the tool.

Th  e team conducts quantitative analysis on a variety of fronts and frequently communicates results 
to key stakeholders in order to build support and engage potential user groups. A weekly people-based

includes ongoing support and technology costs. Th  e team tracks ROI and communicates it frequently 
to stakeholders using a variety of methods.

Intel uses a balanced scorecard framework to focus and calculate the return on value of the ELS. 
Champions are tasked with identifying the speciﬁ c quadrant for which the ELS is intended to provide 
value (ﬁ nancial, customer, internal process, or learning). After the objectives are identiﬁ ed, the team 
can track speciﬁ c metrics and review the ELS-Value Measurement survey that was deployed before and 
after the launch.

LESSONS LEARNED

Intel divides its lessons learned into two categories: success factors and obstacles. Core success factors 
for the ELS deployment included consistent, well-thought-out marketing plans and activities. Th  e plan 
was more detailed than a standard communication plan and focused messages to speciﬁ c groups based 
on business case results and cultures. Th  e marketing and communication plan answered the employees’ 
question, “What is in it for me?” 

Detailing and communicating the individual beneﬁ ts was important. Th  e team used the “train-
the-trainer” and the “teach-to-ﬁ sh” models successfully. Upkeep procedures minimized the investment 
required by the core team and improved the commitment of the end users. Th  e cross-functional skills 
and background of the ELS team served as a broad foundation upon which to build the system and 
leverage experience.

Technology-related success factors for Intel included the decision to build instead of buy the software. 
Embedding the tool in existing business processes and tools played (and continues to play) a pivotal 
role in generating use and commitment across the business. Ensuring that the process is repeatable 
and scalable was a critical success factor and will enable the team to rapidly move from the pilot and 
preliminary deployments to the enterprise-wide deployment. 

Obstacles for the team include the ability to engage the active support of an executive. Although the 
team had the approval of four business managers and fell under the mandate of the KM and IT teams, 
additional executive leverage would have alleviated some of the pressure points and potentially increased 
the speed at which the system passed particular milestones. 

IT factors presented another obstacle and will likely continue to be in most deployments of this kind. 
Speciﬁ cally, the ELS competes for priority with popular “oﬃ  ce tools” in terms of funding, bandwidth, 
and attention. Th  e perception of IT being solely technology and not business savvy was an obstacle to 
be overcome in order to gain the buy-in and support of operations partners.

Th  e most important factor was that behavioral and cultural inﬂ uences had more of an eﬀ ect than 
anticipated. Th  ese inﬂ uences are hard to understand, capture, and address. Lastly, the ELS is a dynamic 
area with a wide variety of variables and few constants.

OVERVIEW OF ELS

Th  e KM strategy is to generate capabilities by enabling knowledge access and exchange. Th  e strategy 
is not a supplemental “thing to do;” it is fully integrated into employees’ daily work and adds eﬀ ectiveness 
as it is realized. Th  e two KM strategic components are knowledge access and knowledge exchange. 

Knowledge objects are readily accessible and are centrally codiﬁ ed and stored. Knowledge access is 
more static than knowledge exchange is and driven by accessibility and retrieval. Knowledge exchange 
generates knowledge through dynamic interactions that are part of getting work done. One outlet to 
knowledge exchange is communities of practice.

Soft (exchange) tools promote collaboration and how that knowledge capital is managed. Soft tools 
include discipline management, communities of practice, mentoring, succession planning, lessons 
learned, and knowledge capture practices.

Hard (access) tools provide the access to knowledge resources and facilitate collaboration and 
knowledge capture and retrieval. Hard tools include expertise locator systems, document management, 
collaboration and learning technology, portals, and collaborative oﬃ  ce environments. Hard tools allow 
Northrop Grumman to address questions such as how to change the environment, how to provide 
information, how to build virtual environments, and how to make technology a sharing and collaborative 
tool and not the driver. 

Th  e company contracted with the Delphi Group to perform a knowledge audit at the air combat 
systems business area of integrated systems. More than 3,600 surveys were completed, and many 
interviews were conducted in order to understand the number of hours spent searching for information. 
Th  e audit revealed that, on average, people spend at least eight hours per week searching for knowledge 
and that the company has a knowledge-sharing culture and valuable peer networks. Th  e audit also 
reconﬁ rmed that people are the primary source of knowledge and the ﬁ rst stop in the search for 
knowledge.

Given the estimate that 80 percent of what people know is tacit knowledge, individuals contact 
peers for answers more often than they search for documents. Th  e amount of time spent by 120,000 
employees searching for information translates to millions of dollars per year. Before implementing an 
ELS, customers waited too long for their questions to be answered and were not conﬁ dent about the 
information they received. 

All company employees have expertise. Th  erefore, expertise location is a key enabler for leveraging 
the collective tacit knowledge of Northrop Grumman. ELS enables the organization to overcome the 
natural impediments of ﬁ nding and gathering people and allows the KM team to view itself as the 
premiere organizational problem solver.

DESIGN AND FEATURES

Northrop Grumman integrated systems (NGIS) connects people and existing databases and taps 
into resources. Parts of the current system include e-mail, training, HR systems, an internally developed 
cross-reference system, and the accompanying interfaces. All expertise locator activities are designed for 
peer-to-peer interaction via a cross-reference tool named the XRef (as in “cross reference”) system.

Locating peers was the original purpose of the XRef system. Th  e tool was created in 1995 speciﬁ cally 
for the B-2 bomber development program that was coming to a close. Its purpose was to keep track 
of the personnel with the program’s engineering expertise and experience as they moved both in and 
out of the program. Of the more than 17,000 program personnel, approximately 1,700 people remain 

126

Expertise Locator Systems: Finding the Answers  •  ©2003 APQC

NORTHROP GRUMMAN

with the support and follow programs for that aircraft. Th  e B-2 customer requires that the same skills 
and capabilities be available to support the aircraft. Lead engineers on the B-2 were able to search for 
individuals who previously worked on the project who could provide solutions to current or reoccurring 
problems.

Th  e ability to track former team members and access their expertise was important to the decision 
to award Northrop Grumman the aircraft’s maintenance contract. In addition, the ability to save time 
searching for answers and to increase the response rate to customers is a cost savings.

In 1997 a KM team was established on the B-2 bomber program, and it began to manage the 
program’s KM activities, including people, process, and document-related projects. Because of the B-2 
bomber program success, the KM team transformed from a program focus to a business area focus in 
1999. In addition, the XRef migrated across multiple programs, and the KM team began to evaluate 
complementary tools to enhance ELS capabilities. In 2000 KM reached an agreement with Tacit, a 
software company, and conducted a pilot. Starting in 2002 a PeopleNet portal was developed, and in 
2003 a Northrop Grumman knowledge strategy was established. Plans for 2004 include a cross-sector 
application for ELS.

Proﬁ le creation is part of the employee annual review process, and a measure in the semiannual 
performance review process is an 80 percent response rate. Employees are required to enter a minimum 
amount of data into the ELS and other data are voluntarily entered. 

Part of the employee proﬁ le is a self-assessment that uses a scale from one to ﬁ ve (beginner to expert). 
Th  e discipline manager (in collaboration with the employee and management) makes the discipline 
management portion of the system assessment.

Expertise is the combination of learning, skill, and life experience. Th  e KM team uses experience 
scales and years of experience categories to identify the level of skill gained. Th  e job of the discipline 
manager is to identify and manage those personnel resources with expertise to support current work and 
respond to future statements of work.

TECHNOLOGY

Th  e XRef system, Northrop Grumman’s peer-to-peer network resource, is user maintained and 
directed. All employees have the ability to access the open system, which is available on a global network, 
and maintain a business proﬁ le. In addition, vendors, contractors, and customers who have access to the 
system for programmatic reasons can gain admission to XRef.

Th  e ownership of the core database is KM. Human resources, business management, engineering, 
and production functions built the interfaces. Those with the need to know own the use of the 
information.

Th  e components are simple; it is a system designed in-house using products the company already 
owned and interface compatible with both clients and Microsoft Internet Explorer. Numerous 
applications (such as client/server, a resource center, portal search engine, and Talent Pool) interface 
with the XRef database.

XRef became a resource for many other processes and interfaces, took advantage of legacy systems, 
and emerged as a database. System growth came from other business groups realizing beneﬁ ts of the 
system, which currently has more than 15,000 active proﬁ les for personnel from 37 diﬀ erent sites. 
Approximately 3,000 users per month log on to XRef. Th  e number of active proﬁ les, the number of 

Expertise Locator Systems: Finding the Answers  •  ©2003 APQC

127

NORTHROP GRUMMAN

sites accessing it, and log-on trends are indicators that XRef and expertise location are becoming part of 
employees’ normal work activities.

Th  e XRef client main screen is simple to use and similar to Microsoft File Manager™. Users can 
search the database by category and keyword, maintain a personal proﬁ le, and track skills and capabilities 
for staﬃ  ng. An example of data in a business proﬁ le include: contact information, responsibilities, 
interests, experiences, skills subjects, computing tools, publications, education and training, and language 
experience.

Personnel may be located by indices of data items such as business skills subjects or programs 
experience. Other ﬁ elds are free text, and the KM team urges the user to check spelling because free 
form text becomes search criteria for the search tools.

Currently, the ELS is not capable of reﬁ ning a search, but XRef allows a “sort and exclusion” of a 
search site. It can drill down to the lowest level on a site, skill, language, or category. Upcoming search 
tools will allow the user to reﬁ ne the search.

IMPLEMENTATION AND LAUNCH

In 2003 Northrop Grumman deployed its Web talent pool site across the integrated systems sector. 
Th  e talent pool is a browser-based interface to the XRef database that does not require a local client. 
Anyone from any sector can tap into the system and utilize the search capabilities. Th  e talent pool also 
allows a user to update the XRef business proﬁ le and search for others across the organization. In fall 
2003 it connected and integrated with the PeopleNet search portal.

Soon after XRef deployed to the engineering, logistics, and technology organizations across the 
integrated systems, sector and the discipline management process was developed. Tools to support this 
process were added to the XRef system. Discipline management consists of skills proﬁ ciency assessment, 
career development planning, and personnel resource management across organizational, program, and 
location boundaries. Discipline management applies KM methodologies in three areas: staﬃ  ng new 
programs faster, improving career planning, and enabling the location of expertise. XRef allows Northrop 
Grumman leaders to reach their vision that when customers engage any entity of Northrop Grumman, 
they have engaged the ability of the entire enterprise. 

E-mail exchange is the most popular communication tool at Northrop Grumman. Other sharing and 
collaboration tools, such as instant messaging, chat rooms, and bulletin boards have been unsuccessful. 
Because e-mail is used so extensively, NGIS decided to leverage the tremendous knowledge resource that 
e-mail represents. Keeping with the general KM philosophy at Northrop Grumman, the adopted system 
is peer-to-peer. Th  ere has been no negative user feedback regarding the use of e-mail traﬃ  c to develop 
user proﬁ les, because user security and privacy features are a critical element to the solution adopted.

NGIS selected ActiveNet, a network solution by Tacit Knowledge Systems, to create proﬁ les based 
on e-mail traﬃ  c product. ActiveNet is a real-time, passive proﬁ ling tool that provides persistent search 
and alert features depending on the user e-mail exchange. Integrated systems conducted two pilots of 
the product. Th  e ﬁ rst occurred in 2000 with 250 users and resulted in sector purchases of user licenses. 
In 2002 a second pilot included an expert locator portal and 450 users. Primary pilot objectives were to 
test small- and large-scale ELS deployment (process, training, software, and hardware), test the expertise 
locator portal, and gain target sector user perspectives. Th  e result of both pilots was the deployment of 
ActiveNet to 10,000 employees in 2003. Presently, every integrated systems sector personnel with a 
network e-mail account will be part of the ActiveNet system.

128

Expertise Locator Systems: Finding the Answers  •  ©2003 APQC

NORTHROP GRUMMAN

During the pilot phase, NGIS promoted ActiveNet as a search tool. Within the ﬁ rst three months, 
the implementation team received several success stories that supported cost savings and eﬃ  ciency gains. 
Initial users also report ﬁ nding experts, others working on the same topics, and responses to technical 
questions. Users can continually share success stories and give suggestions via an embedded program 
feedback mechanism. Integrated systems expects the value of ActiveNet to signiﬁ cantly increase with 
deployment across internal boundaries.

Every e-mail user has a proﬁ le that represents that person’s knowledge, skills, and interests. Th  e user 
proﬁ le consists of two areas: a public area that is viewable only by other Tacit users, and a private area that 
only the proﬁ le creator can access. Because ActiveNet is a real-time system and allows users to continually 
update their proﬁ les, users can locate others working on the same issues. 

Regarding security, the ELS required no additional security beyond what is already in place, as 
appropriate for a defense contractor. Th  e company distinguishes between employees’ unfounded and 
legitimate concerns. Th  e operational model and features explicit to ActiveNet comply with e-mail privacy 
requirements for deployment to those personnel at European sites. Th  at is, legal and HR departments 
have approved ELS privacy and voluntary sharing practices. 

MEASURES AND RESULTS

Integrated systems use several measures to track system use. Collected statistics include the number 
of current proﬁ les, number of sites across the organization, average number of logins per month, and 
growth history. Plans include measuring browser interface use.

Integrated systems uses success stories to share measures and results of its ELS. For example, the 
baseline time for staﬃ  ng new program contracts ranged from six to 12 weeks. Th  e ELS contributed to 
a staﬃ  ng time reduction to less than four weeks. Th  is time saving positively impacted the organization’s 
ability to respond faster to customer staﬃ  ng requirements and realize scheduling cost savings.

A reduction in time to identify internal resources and to identify requested resources are two success 
stories. In less than four hours, the Northrop Grumman team was able to locate an employee who could 
translate Japanese. Th  is represented a cost avoidance of $5,000 dollars in translator fees for this client 
engagement. More importantly, this success left a positive lasting impression on the Japanese customer. 
Th  e second success story involves locating an experienced resource from another organizational sector 
and deploying him to a project within one day. Th  e resource was able to apply his knowledge to save an 
estimated $50,000 in rework.

Another success story is the ability to locate expertise quickly, which aids in the optimization and 
retention of skilled staﬀ . Th  e baseline metric for ﬁ nding an expert ranged from two to ﬁ ve days. With 
the ELS, an expert is located in less than four hours. Th  e ability to locate experts (such as structural 
engineers) and transfer them from one program to another eliminated potential layoﬀ s and reduced cycle 
time to staﬀ  projects. Th  is is an example of exceeding employee expectations, because project members 
staﬃ  ng levels are optimized and staﬀ  reductions are avoided.

Schlumberger Ltd.

Schlumberger Ltd. is an independent global technology services company, headquartered in New 

York City, with 78,000 employees of 140 nationalities. It provides a unique combination of IT and 
energy expertise. It strives to be a committed and trusted partner and is a recognized IT practitioner with 
a proven track record. In 2002 its revenue was $13.6 billion.

Schlumberger’s oilﬁ eld services include surface seismic, wireline logging, drilling and measurements, 
well services, well completions and productivity, geoscience, engineering and economic evaluation 
software, information management, data and consulting services, and Web-enabled solutions. It is 
involved in ﬁ eld operations and integrated project management.

Although most people are familiar with the oilﬁ eld division of Schlumberger, they are not so 
familiar with SchlumbergerSema, which is the IT services, consulting, and systems integration arm of 
the company. SchlumbergerSema provides IT services such as network and infrastructure solutions, 
consulting and systems integration, SmartCards, parking meters, point-of-sale terminals, electricity 
meters, payphones, ticket vending machines, and telecommunications billing and messaging software. 
Th  rough all market cycles, the company invests in technology and research engineering. In 2002 it 
invested $6.5 million in oil ﬁ eld services and in IT. It focuses on speeding up the development process 
and engineering lower cost service delivery.

Schlumberger is located worldwide with laboratories in Ridgeﬁ eld, Conn.; Cambridge, U.K.; 
Stavanger, Norway; Moscow; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Its technology centers are across Texas in 
Houston, Sugarland, and Rosharon; in Princeton, N.J.; across the United Kingdom in Abingdon, 
Gatwick, and Stonehouse; Fuchinobe, Japan; Clamart, France; and Stavanger, Norway. Th  ese research 
laboratories and technology centers in combination with the universities and technology companies 
Schlumberger works with produce a “knowledge factory.” Knowledge generated by these laboratories 
and technology centers must be delivered to the oil companies, which are Schlumberger’s clients, and 
to the GeoMarkets (the geographical areas in which Schlumberger operates). Likewise mechanisms 
are in place to transfer knowledge generated in the GeoMarkets to other GeoMarkets and back to the 
technology centers.

Schlumberger is the oﬁ cial Information Technology Partner for the Olympic Games and is currently 

working on the IT and KM requirements for 2004 Athens Olympics. 

OVERVIEW OF THE ELS

 A corporate directory implemented in 1993 demonstrated the company’s commitment to knowledge 
management. In 1997 Euan Baird, then chairman and CEO of Schlumberger, set the stage for current-
day developments when he said, “To succeed, an organization must create a new work environment 

Expertise Locator Systems: Finding the Answers  •  ©2003 APQC

131

S C H L U M B E R G E R

where knowledge and experience can easily be shared. In such an environment, individuals are able to 
apply their collective knowledge to make optimal decisions—in real time.”

Schlumberger’s goal is to provide the knowledge of the entire organization for all of the decisions the 
organization makes. Employees have real information in real time. “Real time” is deﬁ ned as enough time 
to aﬀ ect the decision. For example, if a team is working on a presentation that is due in two weeks, real 
time may be one week from now. For employees working on a drilling rig, real time to reach a decision 
might be minutes. 

A pivotal year for knowledge management and expertise location was 1997. A group of employees 
met to envision Schlumberger’s future and made decisions that transformed the organization. Th  e group 
decided that Schlumberger should:
• 

split itself into GeoMarkets and segments—the company was a combination of many divisions 
operating separately with limited communication among the divisions; 
apply knowledge in service delivery—the idea was the seed of a system called InTouch;
develop communities of practice—the idea was catalyst for implementing bulletin boards and a system 
called Eureka;
control the organic growth of its intranet—a decision that lead to the creation of “the Hub;” and 
focus on career management. 

• 
• 

• 
• 

In answer to the vision, the employees can now manage careers through technical career ladders, a 

“career network and proﬁ le” process, a career center, and e-learning. 

In 1998 Schlumberger set three goals and three strategies. Th  e goals are to: 

1.  implement world-class technologies,
2.  oﬀ er complete solutions, and 
3.  be the leader or exit.

Two of the three strategies are important to the ELS, and they are to deliver integrated solutions 

locally and concentrate on knowledge management.

GeoMarkets 

Knowledge management is a challenge in an organization as large as Schlumberger that is divided 
into many diﬀ erent segments. For the company, the solution lies in creating GeoMarkets so that it can 
concentrate locally with global services and use knowledge management to ensure that the knowledge in 
one area is shared with other areas. Th  e company has split the globe into three areas, and each of the three 
areas has a number of GeoMarkets. Can knowledge that is applied in one GeoMarket be transferred to 
another? If an expert resides in one GeoMarket, can his or her expertise ﬂ ow to the other GeoMarket? 
Because of the four systems that comprise the ELS, the answers are “yes.”

The Four Systems of the ELS 

Schlumberger does not have one ELS; it has four: the corporate directory, the knowledge Hub, 
Eureka, and InTouch support. Knowledge management grew from the bottom using a Darwinian 
approach—certain ideas survived and others did not. Some of the more successful ideas began as little 
skunkworks projects—small developments in localized areas. When the projects received the recognition 
of management, they gained credibility.

In 1993 technically savvy employees from the Austin oﬃ  ce came across the PH technology from 
the University of Michigan and decided that it would make a good internal directory for the Austin 
oﬃ  ce which was deployed throughout the corporation. Th  e directory took shape further in 1997 when 
the company deployed LDAP system across the organization so that a single “Directory” included both 
employees and expertise. Th  e directory was coupled with the career network and proﬁ le proﬁ les.

In the mid to late 1990s, many small Web sites cropped up, each with a diﬀ erent structure, design, 
and search mechanism. Th  e knowledge Hub brought all the Web sites together with a common 
classiﬁ cation and common search mechanism and also oﬀ ered an easy-to- use content management tool 
that sites could be migrated to.

Eureka began as more than 1,000 bulletin boards that evolved into managed technical communities. 
Schlumberger’s public Web site was based on the same technology as the Hub and became a site devoted 
to the news of the day. Th  e InTouch system rose up from the 1998 District 2000 project. 

Today, portfolio management is important to the company. Managers are ensuring that IT projects 

are managed from “Project Oﬃ  ce,” a central place, so that groups are not duplicating systems. 

Th  e KM strategy has been to connect people to people through the directory, connect people to 
communities of practice through Eureka, connect people to information through Th  e Hub, and connect 
people to best practices through InTouch. All of the four systems have an element in them that relates 
to expertise location. 

Schlumberger’s Approach to the ELS 

Schlumberger’s current approach to the ELS is primarily corporate, but the systems began locally. 
When grassroots eﬀ orts reach management’s radar, management determines if they are suitable for the 
entire organization. InTouch began in drilling and measurements and then expanded to oilﬁ eld services, 
but it is now migrating to SchlumbergerSema. Th  e directory existed at the corporate level in 1993, and 
all employees developed proﬁ les in 1998. Th  e ELS is part of the knowledge management strategy, and 
it is integrated with the communities of practice.

S C H L U M B E R G E R

Retirees Access the ELS

For some time, Schlumberger has been considering the use of retirees as experts in response to the 

brain drain that has been occurring in its industry.

To present an eﬀ ective business cases for knowledge management, leaders of initiatives:
solicit management sponsors;
set realistic expectations;

• 
• 
•  present believable measurements; and 
• 

start small, but think big.

To receive executive buy-in, ﬁ nd the right executive. Th  e KM leaders see no beneﬁ t in taking an 
initiative to an executive who does not believe in knowledge management. When the leader does ﬁ nd the 
right executive, he or she nurtures the relationship by communicating frequently regarding the progress 
of the projects.

Schlumberger’s story of how it invested in the 1990s is probably not relevant in 2003. Because the 
company was learning as it was going, progress was slow. People beginning now have the luxury of faster 
execution. However, no matter when the knowledge management initiative begins, it still requires an 
initial investment in technology and culture. 

Th  e primary users of the ELS are “worker bees.” Th  ey are in the GeoMarket staﬀ  and may be located 
in swamps, deserts, or on oﬀ shore platforms. Th  e four systems of the ELS provide the knowledge they 
need to do their jobs. Th  e technology centers and human resources are also users of the ELS. 

All applications are Web-enabled and can be searched or browsed. One system has a service desk. 
People can contact experts through a Web application, the telephone, or e-mail, and entire communities 
of experts can be contacted simultaneously. Th  e ELS does not require that questions be framed in a 
certain way, and experts can be located in just a few moments. 

Both push and pull strategies are used to attract users to the ELS. Because the experts directory 
records for themselves, they pull people toward them; the experts are advertising themselves as publishers 
of content. Th  e system also sends e-mail to groups created by the directory or bulletin boards. 

DESIGN AND FEATURES
The Directory

When a new employee enters the company, he or she receives a SAP HR record, which stays with the 
employee until termination. When the employee leaves the company, the record disappears immediately, 
and all access to the networks and the facilities stops.

Th  e SAP HR record automatically generates the directory record, which includes a name, phone 
numbers, an e-mail address, time zone (important in a global community), and other basic information, 
which the user adds to in order to enrich the content. Th  e record contains the organizational unit the 
employee works in, his or her manager, a job title, and a list of expertise. Th  e expertise is not located 
in the directory system but is populated through the Eureka system. Th  e directory has room for the 
individual’s schedule; and people customize the area with the dates they will be out of the oﬃ  ce or with a 
URL that links to the personal calendar. Th  e directory contains a list of subscriptions to bulletin boards 
and career information, including what courses the employee has taken.

Employees have the option to publish basic contact information on the public Web site. (Many 
people do not want any details published.) It has room for optional information such as personal contact 
and family details. Th  e directory record and career network and proﬁ le Web page is linked. 

The Eureka System

Th  e Eureka system is the home for technical and business communities of practice. Twenty-ﬁ ve 
major communities (with 142 special interest communities embedded in them) share more than 14,000 
members. A community of practice can vary in size from 4,500 members to 50 members. 

Th  e Eureka system links to knowledge repositories, news, and events that a particular community 
is interested in. Communities create surveys to canvas their members, and each community has elected 
leaders who serve for a year. Smaller communities may have only two leaders, but larger ones have ﬁ ve or 
six. Th  e role of the leaders is to welcome new members and generate activity and make sure that people 
who are sending messages to the bulletin board receive a response. Th  e Eureka site is used not only by 
practitioners, but also by top executives who see the community as a source of expertise and advise.

Although Schlumberger does not yet mine the bulletin boards, it searches them for information. 
It is implementing new technology that will allow it to ﬁ nd “nuggets” through the mining process for 
information sharing.

Career network and proﬁ les are part of Eureka, and they act as online resumes. Anyone can have a 
career network and proﬁ le; membership in a community is not a prerequisite. career network and proﬁ les 
contain:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  patent work and professional achievements; 
• 
• 

some directory information;
a personal statement (optional);
current projects including URLs to the Web pages of projects that the employee is involved in;
areas of free-form text for the employee to describe his or her expertise;
education (names of universities and references to theses, dissertations, and publications);

a history of work at Schlumberger (and at other companies); and
job skills and classiﬁ cation. 

Skills are classiﬁ ed manually using the Schlumberger master classiﬁ cation system. Employees built 
the classiﬁ cation of skills by examining published classiﬁ cation schemes and brainstorming how the 
classiﬁ cation looks at Schlumberger. Th  e oil ﬁ eld division of the business is rolling out an extremely 
detailed classiﬁ cation of skills.

Th  e classiﬁ cation system is multifaceted with categories of skills, subject matters, organizational 
structure, geographical structures, and languages; and it standardizes terms of speech. For example, an 
employee may want to know something about a cell phone, but the answer to her question is under 
“mobile phone.” Th  e organization creates a common language for publications. According to a KM 
champion, “It is a challenge to put things in one place and ﬁ nd them in the same place.” 

Eureka leaders encourage employees to post happy pictures and personal interests because these break 
down barriers. Using just one search screen, employees can search Eureka by memberships, proﬁ les, or the 
directory. Th  e search can be further limited to “part of the organization” or “geographical location.”

The InTouch System

Th  e InTouch system is a combination of knowledge base (which includes best practices, lessons 
learned, solutions, and reference manuals) and service desks that are manned by experienced oilﬁ eld 
engineers. Field engineers with problems search the InTouch knowledge base, and if it does not provide 
a solution, they contact (via the Internet or telephone) the InTouch engineers who man the service desks. 
If the InTouch engineers do not know the answers, they have a network of people to contact. Th  ere are 
1,600 oﬃ  cially designated support experts: subject matter experts, Segment knowledge champions, 
GeoMarket knowledge champions, and applied community experts. Th  e support experts spend a portion 
of their time providing expertise, which is a component of their job description and objectives.

Th  e company has 86 service desks manned by 200 InTouch engineers, and each service desk is 
assigned a particular product or service. Th  e InTouch engineers work full time on the service desks for 
two to three years and then cycle back into the ﬁ eld, possibly as an applied community expert. 

People are encouraged to search for the answers to their questions in the database before moving on 
to the service desk. Th  e answer to every question that is answered by the service desk is published so that 
it does not have to be answered again. Th  e InTouch system shares some content with the Hub, but the 
InTouch system is geared to ﬁ eld operations in the GeoMarkets. 

The Hub

Th  e Hub has a Yahoo-type navigation system. It lets the employee choose products, services, 
divisions, locations, etc. Schlumberger has a common classiﬁ cation nomenclature between the Hub and 
the InTouch system so that classiﬁ cation is consistent. 

Th  e Hub identiﬁ es authors of the publications posted on it so that employees can contact the authors. 
Th  e Hub acts as a signpost that invites the reader to “contact this person for that information” or “click 
here to join this bulletin board.” Employees gain access to el-earning and training through the Hub. 

Th  e Hub provides a consolidated search and allows employees to use it to access material in the career 

network and proﬁ les, the directory, and on other Web sites that are not as yet part of the Hub. 

General Comments

All four of the ELS components are owned by corporate IT, and they are funded centrally. No one 
department is paying for them; they are part of corporate overhead. Schlumberger did try to benchmark 
knowledge management in the early 1990s, but without much information available, most of their 
progress was through “trial and error.”

Th  e information in the proﬁ les and in the directory is published voluntarily. Employees themselves 
are responsible for the personal information content, but Schlumberger has a culture of feedback. 
Th  erefore, if a person recognizes an error in another employee’s information, he or she is empowered to 
politely point it out to either the employee or the system administrator. 

A KM champion distinguishes between questions that are “critical” and “not critical.” Both types of 
questions are equally important. An example of a critical question is a ﬁ eld engineer asking a technical 
question with the possibility of interrupting the drilling of a well. A bulletin board would not be the 
proper forum to discuss the question because the engineer needs an expert (InTouch) opinion. A software 
developer working through some bugs also has an important question, but the answer is not critical. 
He or she could pose the question to a bulletin board and receive various opinions about how to work 
through the software problems.

Schlumberger does not have the ability to mine information communicated from one e-mail box to 

another. It is aware of the technology, but is not comfortable with it yet.

LAUNCH

Implementing the usage of the system required organizational change. Employees had to change 

their behaviors for each of the four initiatives:
1.  The directory—to update the directory, the company held PHdays  twice a year. Directory managers 
sent employees e-mail messages and hung posters to encourage the employees to update their records. 
During the event, those who updated their records were entered for prize drawings. (Except in a small 
part of the organization, the company no longer needs PHdays, because employees routinely keep 
their records up-to-date.)

2.  Career network and profiles—employees are responsible for maintaining the proﬁ les, though a 
manager might have as an objective that 80 percent of the employees in the department have a career 
network and proﬁ le. Th  e managers roll the objectives down to the employee level, and employees are 
told in January that they are to have a proﬁ le developed by the end of the year. Many organizations 
have high participation: 90 percent of their employees have career network and proﬁ les. Human 
resources uses the career network and proﬁ le as a starting point when it looks for people to ﬁ ll internal 
jobs. Th  ose without a career network and proﬁ le do not receive promotions or lateral moves—and 
that serves as a good way to encourage people to create a one. 

3.  InTouch—this system involves excessive training, champions worldwide in the GeoMarket locations, 
and objectives for each employee regarding the level of use. A tipping point  has occurred in which 
employees think “everyone is doing it, so why don’t you.”

4.  The Hub—provides consolidated searches to access materials in the career network and proﬁ les, the 

directory, and other Web sites.

Sema Example

Schlumberger works to transfer its culture to organizations that it acquires. When Schlumberger 
acquired Sema, Sema was not accustomed to the idea of a directory. In fact, the culture was anti-
directories. Sema management had made an intentional decision not to have personal information 
available because they wanted to prevent outsiders from receiving a long list of everybody in the 
organization. 

Schlumberger pulled information from Sema’s human resources system into the directory system 
and generated a record for each employee. Many Sema employees had records that were not up-to-date, 
and the cultural change required for employees to update their records took three or four months. (It 
was a busy time for the Sema employees because they were moving oﬃ  ce locations and changing e-mail 
addresses and telephone numbers.) For the four months, the veteran Schlumberger employees were 
frustrated because they could not contact Sema employees. All at once, all of the Sema employees got 
onboard with the system, and their records are now consistently up-to-date. Th  e Sema employees reached 
a tipping point.

Reward and Recognition

Of the total Schlumberger employee population, 20 percent are involved in Eureka. Approximately 
50 percent of all employees have a proﬁ le. Schlumberger’s technical staﬀ  belong to Eureka, and of the 
population of Eureka, 90 percent have a proﬁ le.

Employees are not speciﬁ cally rewarded for having a proﬁ le, except in increased networking 
opportunities. InTouch is diﬀ erent from career network and proﬁ le and has an extensive reward and 
recognition system associated with it, which takes the form of a “frequent ﬂ yer system.” Employees 
receive points if they use information that has been published in InTouch or if the information that they 
publish is used. Th  e higher the quality rating of the information, the more points they receive. Prizes for 
the most points are awarded at the GeoMarket and segment level, each quarter.

Schlumberger does have a culture of sharing and helping, and it is one that grows and inﬂ uences 
other employees. A KM champion said, “If you are in an organization where you can ask a questions and 
receive help, you become willing to give help yourself.” 

Participation is always voluntary, however encouraged. According to the KM champion, “If you 
know your career will be enhanced by having a career network and proﬁ le, you become very willing to 
put one into place. And if your directory does not have a correct e-mail address or telephone number, 
no one will get hold of you and your career will ﬁ zzle in no time at all.”

Employees engaged in conference calls have the proﬁ les of each of the call participants open on their 
desktops. Employees can see pictures and personality details of the participants, so the career network 
and proﬁ les provide a head start in the process of becoming acquainted. When employees realize that 
others are using and depending on the career network and proﬁ le information, they keep the information 
current. 

Barriers to the Continued Use of the ELS

Experts could become frustrated that they are answering the same question multiple times. Anyone 
who asks a question for which the answer is already published is notiﬁ ed politely that the answer already 
exists. 

Employees do become unengaged from the bulletin boards, and some unsubscribe. Managers set 
protocol for board use and enforce it through polite one-to-one e-mail messages to the oﬀ enders. Points 
of protocol include:
• 
• 

no inappropriate traffic—people must direct their questions to the most appropriate board, and 
no large attachments—large attachments waste both disk space and bandwidth. (Th  e protocol is to 
publish the ﬁ le and send the URL.) 

Managers encourage employees to post happy, informal pictures on their proﬁ les. Th  ese break down 
barriers and encourage others to call. Individuals have personal objectives tied to maintaining or using 
the ELS.

Incentives are less important as people begin to accept the beneﬁ ts of the system. Now, if employees 
change e-mail addresses or cell phone numbers, they go immediately to the directory. Now, if employees 
have content, they publish automatically. Th  e company stops the incentive programs when they are no 
longer needed.

TECHNOLOGY AND MAINTENANCE

All four of the systems—the directory, the Hub, Eureka, and InTouch—were built in-house rather 
than purchased. Th  e technology to carry out the company’s vision was not available in the late 1990s. 
Schlumberger may buy rather than build its second generation of tools. It is developing return on 
investment cases now. Th  e reasons for buying rather than building are to reduce the cost of maintenance; 
to lengthen the product life cycle, which is shorter on internally built technology; and to “use what it 
sells and sell what it uses,” which is important to a consulting company that requires technology be 
implemented in other companies. 

Technology of the Directory

Schlumberger continues to use the scripts it developed in-house to walk employees through 
entering information into the directory. It is considering a commercial content management tool. 
Directory support is a management team of one, and the company has outsourced its IT function to 
SchlumbergerSema. Th  e team in SchlumbergerSema manages not only the directory but also other 
systems. 

Th  e use of the directory has increased because it is the tool for authentication. For instance, security 
uses the directory to allow employees access to buildings. In 1997 the directory had three servers: one in 
London, one in Houston, and a failsafe one in Houston. Because of the increased use of the system, the 
company added two servers: one in Brussels and one in Singapore. Th  e management of these servers is 
taking more time. 

Technology of Eureka and the Career Network and Profiles

Eureka is an in-house tool consisting of a Web application and an Oracle database. A management 
team of three people develops the Web pages behind Eureka (and career network and proﬁ le). However, 
Eureka is much more than just that. Th  e team has access to corporate libraries of periodicals, as well as 
a technical career ladder, which is an outreach system of relationships with universities that is run by 
Eureka. A three-person team manages all the systems. Th  e actual development of the search and career 
network and proﬁ le is in maintenance mode and not being expanded now. Eureka costs little to maintain 
and is being maintained by a small contract company in Paris. 

Technology of InTouch

Schlumberger built the InTouch tool in-house, and it consists of a Web application, a service 
desk, and a knowledge base with an Oracle database behind it. It has a commercial search engine. 
SchlumbergerSema manages InTouch, and because Schlumberger is looking at third-party components 
and the system is expanding, a larger team is involved with it at the moment. If InTouch were in 
maintenance mode, two or three people could maintain it. 

Th  e company has two separate search engines: one for the Hub, and one for InTouch. Th  e one on 
the Hub covers everything excluding InTouch, but the other covers only InTouch. Th  e organization is 
considering consolidating and having one search engine.

S C H L U M B E R G E R

Technology of The Hub

Th  e Hub tool was built in-house and consists of a Web application for the front end and an Oracle 
database. It has a commercial search engine. Schlumberger is deploying commercial components for 
classiﬁ cation and Web content management in October 2003. Th  e Hub is supported by a team of three 
and maintained by SchlumbergerSema.

The Integration of the ELS

Th  e ELS integrates to various levels with:
human resources—the directory is fully integrated with SAP HR;
customer relationship management—CRM is considered a knowledge management system and is 
used mostly in sales. (Th  e information in it is sensitive, so it is separate from the other systems and 
integrates little with the ELS.); 
collaboration—Schlumberger uses ProjectNet, an oﬀ -the-shelf project collaboration tool that 
allows the documents involved in a project to be published to the project team. (Th  e leader of 
KM community believes that publishing documents in a collaboration space does not constitute 
“enterprise KM” and processes need to be in place to ensure best practices are transferred from 
project space to enterprise best practice systems.);
portals—portal technology is used simply to personalize and customize content (Schlumberger uses 
no commercial portal products now but could for the development of the Hub II.); 
content management tools—are used in InTouch and the Hub. (Currently, they are in-house built, 
but the company will implement commercial versions.); 
directory tool—Schlumberger uses a commercial LDAP directory and is considering moving to a 
commercial directory content management tool; 
authentication—is used for edits and feedback (InTouch, the Hub, and Eureka use the directory to 
permit access.); and
e-mail—is commercial and is used by the bulletin boards, the Hub, InTouch, and Eureka.

Maintenance of the ELS

Now that the systems are throughout the enterprise, they are supported and developed by the 
corporate information systems. No small skunkworks exists. Th  e directory, Eureka career network and 
proﬁ le, and are operating at a basic level. Th  e directory has one thought leader and a small support team 
for the ﬁ ve LDAP servers. Th  ree people manage Eureka and have a small support staﬀ . 

MEASURES

• 

Th  e number of measures in place is dependent on the life cycle position of the initiative.
The directory—except to measure system usage, Schlumberger does not spend too much time 
measuring the use of the directory. Because its return on investment is already proved, spending 
resources to measure activity is not necessary. Th  e directory’s site (the LDAP) has approximately 11 
million hits per week, so the company has no need to drive increased participation.

•  Career network and profile—the company measures the number of updates and the ratio of the 
employees who have them, but it does not measure accuracy of the entries. Th  e proﬁ les in career 
network and proﬁ le have demonstrated a tremendous return on investment, so they do not require 
further proof of their value.

S C H L U M B E R G E R

• 
• 

The Hub—hits and another matrix, including content updates, are measured.
InTouch—is measured extensively. Th  e company analyzes calls to the service desk to determine 
employee learning gaps or missing pieces of information.

Most of the measures are available online, and employees can go to the Hub to see the level of new 

or modiﬁ ed content. Th  e measures are split by GeoMarkets and segments.

LESSONS LEARNED

If the Schlumberger team began again, it would have:
the directory proﬁ le and career network and proﬁ le be on the same system and not require a hyperlink 
between the two and 
commercial content management tools for the directory and other applications. 

• 

• 

A lesson learned is: “You can never overestimate the need for change management. Build it and they 

will not come unless they are encouraged.” 

Critical Success Factors 

• 
• 
• 
• 

• 
• 

A number of factors have helped Schlumberger succeed.
Its career network and proﬁ les and directory are easy to maintain.
It has developed a common language for skills (classiﬁ cation).
It has comprehensively managed change.
It has removed or combined competing systems. Employees should not need to use two or more 
systems, because encouraging people to change their information in one system is diﬃ  cult enough. 
Trying to encourage them to update two systems may be impossible.
It works from the enterprise level and identiﬁ es experts in one location to help the other locations.
It is not hung up on the validation of skills and experts. One percent of the people in any organization 
may misrepresent their skills, but 99 percent of the people will be accurate. People have more of 
a tendency to underestimate what they do rather than overestimate. Schlumberger does not halt 
the good that can come from an ELS system because a couple of people’s information may be 
inaccurate.

Unforeseen Obstacle 

Because the four diﬀ erent systems—the directory, the Hub, Eureka, and InTouch—began in four 
diﬀ erent locations at four diﬀ erent times, the technological choices made by each group are not entirely 
compatible. To overcome this obstacle, a company that is beginning to implement the ELS must have 
IT standards and portfolio management early in its knowledge management career so it can catch the 
technologies early enough to make a diﬀ erence.

S C H L U M B E R G E R

What Works Well and What Does Not
1.  It is diﬃ  cult to predict if technology systems will last. For example, Schlumberger ﬁ rst used Cold 

Fusion rather than Java.

2.  Employees never know in advance where the company itself is headed. Schlumberger has become an 
IT systems integration and consulting company, and could have made diﬀ erent decisions to position 
itself regarding its new core competency.

3.  Schlumberger’s unmanned bulletin boards could have been better managed at their inception. 
Bulletin boards that spring up throughout an organization are not a good way of solving the problem 
of the lack of expertise.

4.  Self-service works well if it is encouraged.
5.  If Schlumberger had to “do it over,” it would have commercial components that are well-integrated 
with each other and a single source of information about people—a goal the company has almost 
reached.

Plans for Expansion and Growth

Schlumberger will concentrate on continuous improvement and culture change. It is still working 

on making business cases and calculating returns on investments for the various improvements.
